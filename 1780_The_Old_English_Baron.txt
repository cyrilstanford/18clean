To Mrs. Bridgen. 
Madam, 
This new Edition of the English Baron (which is in fact the Third) begs permission to acknowledge your patronage and protection, of which it has long since felt the advantages. 
You cast an eye of favour upon his first appearance, under all the disadvantages of an incorrect and very faulty impression; You took him out of this degrading dress, and encouraged him to assume a graceful and ornamental habit. 
You did still more for him. -You took upon yourself the trouble to revise and correct the errors of the first impression; and, in short, you gave him all the graces necessary to solicit and obtain the notice and approbation of the Public. 
The Author cannot fully enjoy her success, without acknowledging from whence she in a great measure derives it. 
You, Madam, as becomes the daughter of Richardson, are more solicitous to deserve the acknowledgments of a grateful heart, than to receive them. -You have no reason to suspect me of flattery, but of vanity you may, in wishing to mention your name thus publicly as the patroness and friend of, 
Madam, 
Your most obliged humble Servant, 
CLARA REEVE. 
Sept. 1,

PREFACE. 
As this Story is of a species which, tho' not new, is out of the common track, it has been thought necessary to point out some circumstances to the reader, which will elucidate the design, and, it is hoped, will induce him to form a favourable, as well as a right judgment of the work before him. 
This Story is the literary offspring of the Castle of Otranto, written upon the same plan, with a design to unite the most attractive and interesting circumstances of the ancient Romance and modern Novel, at the same time it assumes a character and manner of its own, that differs from both; it is distinguished by the appellation of a Gothic Story, being a picture of Gothic times and manners. Fictitious Stories have been the delight of all times and all countries, by oral tradition in barbarous, by writing in more civilized ones; and 
[Page iv]
although some persons of wit and learning have condemned them indiscriminately, I would venture to affirm, that even those who so much affect to despise them under one form, will receive and embrace them under another. 
Thus, for instance, a man shall admire and almost adore the Epic poems of the Ancients, and yet despise and execrate the ancient Romances, which are only Epics in prose. 
History represents human nature as it is in real life;-alas, too often a melancholy retrospect! -Romance displays only the amiable side of the picture; it shews the pleasing features, and throws a veil over the blemishes: Mankind are naturally pleased with what gratifies their vanity; and vanity, like all other passions of the human heart, may be rendered subservient to good and useful purposes. 
I confess that it may be abused, and become an instrument to corrupt the manners and morals of mankind; so may poetry, so may plays, so may every kind of composition; but that will prove nothing 
[Page v]
more than the old saying lately revived by the philosophers the most in fashion, "" 
The business of Romance is, first, to excite the attention; and secondly, to direct it to some useful, or at least innocent, end: Happy the writer who attains both these points, like Richardson! and not unfortunate, or undeserving praise, he who gains only the latter, and furnishes out an entertainment for the reader! 
Having, in some degree, opened my design, I beg leave to conduct my reader back again, till he comes within view of the Castle of Otranto; a work which, as already has been observed, is an attempt to unite the various merits and graces of the ancient Romance and modern Novel. To attain this end, there is required a sufficient degree of the marvellous, to excite the attention; enough of the manners of real life, to give an air of probability to the work; and enough of the pathetic, to engage the heart in its behalf. 
The book we have mentioned is excellent in the two last points, but has a redundancy in the first; the opening excites the 
[Page vi]
attention very strongly; the conduct of the story is artful and judicious; the characters are admirably drawn and supported; the diction polished and elegant; yet, with all these brilliant advantages, it palls upon the mind (though it does not upon the ear); and the reason is obvious, the machinery is so violent, that it destroys the effect it is intended to excite. Had the story been kept within the utmost verge of probability, the effect had been preserved, without losing the least circumstance that excites or detains the attention. 
For instance; we can conceive, and allow of, the appearance of a ghost; we can even dispense with an enchanted sword and helmet; but then they must keep within certain limits of credibility: A sword so large as to require an hundred men to lift it; a helmet that by its own weight forces a passage through a court-yard into an arched vault, big enough for a man to go through; a picture that walks out of its frame; a skeleton ghost in a hermit's cowl: -When your expectation is wound up to the highest pitch, these circumstances take it down 
[Page vii]
with a witness, destroy the work of imagination, and, instead of attention, excite laughter. I was both surprised and vexed to find the enchantment dissolved, which I wished might continue to the end of the book; and several of its readers have confessed the same disappointment to me: The beauties are so numerous, that we cannot bear the defects, but want it to be perfect in all respects. 
In the course of my observations upon this singular book, it seemed to me that it was possible to compose a work upon the same plan, wherein these defects might be avoided; and the keeping, as in painting, might be preserved. 
But then I began to fear it might happen to me as to certain translators, and imitators of Shakespeare; the unities may be preserved, while the spirit is evaporated. However, I ventured to attempt it; I read the beginning to a circle of friends of approved judgment, and by their approbation was encouraged to proceed, and to finish it. 

[Page viii]
By the advice of the same friends I printed the first Edition in the country, where it circulated chiefly, very few copies being sent to London; and being thus encouraged, I have determined to offer a second Edition to that public which has so often rewarded the efforts of those, who have endeavoured to contribute to its entertainment. 
The work has lately undergone a revision and correction, the former Edition being very incorrect; and by the earnest solicitation of several friends, for whose judgment I have the greatest deference, I have consented to a change of the title from the Champion of Virtue to the Old English Baron: -as that character is thought to be the principal one in the story. 
I have also been prevailed upon, though with extreme reluctance, to suffer my name to appear in the title-page; and I do now, with the utmost respect and diffidence, submit the whole to the candour of the Public.

THE OLD ENGLISH BARON: A GOTHIC STORY. 
In the minority of Henry the Sixth, King of England, when the renowned John Duke of Bedford was Regent of France, and Humphrey the good Duke of Gloucester was Protector of England, a worthy Knight, called Sir Philip Harclay, returned from his travels to England, his native country. He had served under the glorious King Henry the Fifth with distinguished valour, had acquired an honourable fame, and was no less esteemed for christian virtues than for deeds of chivalry. After the death of his Prince, he entered into the service of the Greek Emperor, and distinguished his courage against the encroachments of the Saracens. In a battle there, he took prisoner a certain 
[Page 2]
Gentleman, by name M. Zadisky, of Greek extraction, but brought up by a Saracen Officer; this man he converted to the Christian faith; after which he bound him to himself by the ties of friendship and gratitude, and he resolved to continue with his Benefactor. After thirty years travel and warlike service, he determined to return to his native land, and to spend the remainder of his life in peace; and, by devoting himself to works of piety and charity, prepare for a better state hereafter. 
This noble Knight had, in his early youth, contracted a strict friendship with the only son of the Lord Lovel; a gentleman of eminent virtues and accomplishments. During Sir Philip's residence in foreign countries, he had frequently written to his friend, and had for a time received answers; the last informed him of the death of old Lord Lovel, and the marriage of the young one; but from that time he had heard no more from him. Sir Philip imputed it not to neglect or forgetfulness, but to the difficulties of intercourse, common at that time to all travellers and adventurers. When he was returning home, he resolved, after looking into his family affairs, to visit the castle of Lovel, and enquire into the situation of his friend. He landed in Ken attended by his Greek friend and two faithful servants, one of which was maimed 
[Page 3]
by the wounds he had received in the defence of his Master. 
Sir Philip went to his family-seat in Yorkshire: he found his mother and sister were dead, and his estates sequestered in the hands of Commissioners appointed by the Protector. He was obliged to prove the reality of his claim, and the identity of his person (by the testimony of some of the old servants of his family), after which every thing was restored to him. He took possession of his own house, established his household, settled the old servants in their former stations, and placed those he brought home in the upper offices of his family. He then left his friend to superintend his domestic affairs; and, attended by only one of his old servants, he set out for the castle of Lovel, in the west of England. They travelled by easy journeys; but, towards the evening of the second day, the servant was so ill and fatigued he could go no further; he stopped at an inn where he grew worse every hour, and the next day expired. Sir Philip was under great concern for the loss of his servant, and some for himself, being alone in a strange place; however he took courage, ordered his servant's funeral, attended it himself, and, having shed a tear of humanity over his grave, proceeded alone on his journey. 

[Page 4]
As he drew near the estate of his friend, he began to enquire of every one he met, whether the Lord Lovel resided at the seat of his ancestors? He was answered by one,-he did not know;-by another, he could not tell;-by a third, that he never heard of such a person. Sir Philip thought it strange that a man of Lord Lovel's consequence should be unknown in his own neighbourhood, and where his ancestors had usually resided. He ruminated on the uncertainty of human happiness: This world, said he, has nothing for a wise man to depend upon. I have lost all my relations, and most of my friends; and am even uncertain whether any are remaining: I will, however, be thankful for the blessings that are spared to me; and I will endeavour to replace those that I have lost. If my friend lives, he shall share my fortune with me; his children shall have the reversion of it; and I will share his comforts in return. But perhaps my friend may have met with troubles that have made him disgusted with the world: Perhaps he has buried his amiable wife, or his promising children; and, tired of public life, he is retired into a monastery. At least, I will know what all this silence means. 
When he came within a mile of the Castle of Lovel, he stopped at a cottage, and asked for a draught of water: A Peasant, master of the 
[Page 5]
house, brought it, and asked if his Honour would alight and take a moment's refreshment. Sir Philip accepted his offer, being resolved to make farther enquiry before he approached the Castle. He asked the same questions of him, that he had before of others. -Which Lord Lovel, said the man, does your Honour enquire after? -The man whom I knew was called Arthur, said Sir Philip. -Ay, said the Peasant, he was the only surviving son of Richard Lord Lovel, as I think? -Very true, friend, he was so. - Alas, Sir, said the man, he is dead! he survived his father but a short time. -Dead! say you? how long since? -About fifteen years, to the best of my remembrance. -Sir Philip sighed deeply-Alas, said he, what do we, by living long, but survive all our friends! But pray tell me how he died? -I will, Sir, to the best of my knowledge. An't please your Honour, I heard say, that he attended the King when he went against the Welch Rebels, and he left his Lady big with child; and so there was a battle fought, and the King got the better of the Rebels: There came first a report that none of the Officers were killed; but a few days after there came a messenger with an account very different, that several were wounded, and that the Lord Lovel was slain; which sad news overset us all with sorrow, for he was a noble Gentleman, a 
[Page 6]
bountiful Master, and the delight of all the neighbourhood. -He was indeed, said Sir Philip, all that is amiable and good; he was my dear and noble friend, and I am inconsolable for his loss: But the unfortunate Lady, what became of her? -Why, a'nt please your Honour, they said she died of grief for the loss of her husband; but her death was kept private for a time, and we did not know it for certain till some weeks afterwards. -The will of Heaven be obeyed! said Sir Philip; but who succeeded to the title and estate? The next heir, said the Peasant, a kinsman of the deceased, Sir Walter Lovel by name. -I have seen him, said Sir Philip, formerly; but where was he when these events happened? -At the Castle of Lovel, Sir; he came there on a visit to the Lady, and waited there to receive my Lord, at his return from Wales; when the news of his death arrived, Sir Walter did every thing in his power to comfort her, and some said he was to marry her; but she refused to be comforted, and took it so to heart that she died. -And does the present Lord Lovel reside at the Castle? -No, Sir.-Who then? -The Lord Baron Fitz Owen. -And how came Sir Walter to leave the seat of his ancestors? -Why, Sir, he married his sister to this said Lord; and so he sold the Castle to him, and went away, and built himself a house in the 
[Page 7]
north country, as far as Northumberland, I think they call it. -That is very strange! said Sir Philip. -So it is, please your Honour; but this is all I know about it. -I thank you, friend, for your intelligence; I have taken a long journey to no purpose, and have met with nothing but cross accidents. This life is, indeed, a pilgrimage! Pray direct me the nearest way to the next Monastery. Noble Sir, said the Peasant, it is full five miles off, the night is coming on, and the ways are bad; I am but a poor man, and cannot entertain your Honour as you are used to; but if you will enter my poor cottage, that, and every thing in it, are at your service. My honest friend, I thank you heartily, said Sir Philip; your kindness and hospitality might shame many of higher birth and breeding; I will accept your kind offer: But pray let me know the name of my host? -John Wyatt, Sir; an honest man though a poor one, and a Christian man, though a sinful one. -Whose cottage is this? -It belongs to the Lord Fitz-Owen. - What family have you? -A wife, two sons and a daughter, who will all be proud to wait upon your Honour; let me hold your Honour's stirrup whilst you alight. He seconded these words by the proper action, and having assisted his guest to dismount, he conducted him into his house, called his wife to attend him, and then 
[Page 8]
led his horse under a poor shed, that served him as a stable. Sir Philip was fatigued in body and mind, and was glad to repose himself any where. The courtesy of his host engaged his attention, and satisfied his wishes. He soon after returned, followed by a youth of about eighteen years; Make haste, John, said the father, and be sure you say neither more nor less than what I have told you. I will, father, said the lad; and immediately set off, ran like a buck across the fields, and was out of sight in an instant. I hope, friend, said Sir Philip, you have not sent your son to provide for my entertainment; I am a soldier, used to lodge and fare hard; and, if it were otherwise, your courtesy and kindness would give a relish to the most ordinary food. I wish heartily, said Wyatt, it was in my power to entertain your Honour as you ought to be; but, as I cannot do so, I will, when my son returns, acquaint you with the errand I sent him on. After this they conversed together on common subjects, like fellow-creatures of the same natural form and endowments, though different kinds of education had given a conscious superiority to the one, a conscious inferiority to the other; and the due respect was paid by the latter, without being exacted by the former. In about half an hour young John returned. -Thou hast made haste, said the father. Not more than 
[Page 9]
good speed, quoth the son. -Tell us, then, how you speed? -Shall I tell all that passed? said John. -All, said the father; I don't want to hide any thing. John stood with his cap in his hand, and thus told his tale. -I went straight to the Castle as fast as I could run; it was my hap to light on young Master Edmund first, so I told him just as you bad me, that a noble Gentleman was come a long journey from foreign parts to see the Lord Lovel, his friend; and, having lived abroad many years, he did not know that he was dead, and that the Castle was fallen into other hands; that upon hearing these tidings he was much grieved and disappointed, and wanting a night's lodging, to rest himself before he returned to his own home, he was fain to take up with one at our cottage; that my father thought my Lord would be angry with him, if he were not told of the stranger's journey and intentions, especially to let such a man lie at our cottage, where he could neither be lodged nor entertained according to his quality. Here John stopped, and his father exclaimed- A good lad! you did your errand very well; and tell us the answer. -John proceeded-Master Edmund ordered me some beer, and went to acquaint my Lord of the message; he stayed a while, and then came back to me. John, said he, tell the noble stranger, that the Baron Fitz-Owen 
[Page 10]
greets him well, and desires him to rest assured, that though Lord Lovel is dead, and the Castle fallen into other hands, his friends will always find a welcome there; and my Lord desires that he will accept of a lodging there, while he remains in this country-so I came away directly, and made haste to deliver my errand. 
Sir Philip expressed some dissatisfaction at this mark of old Wyatt's respect-I wish, said he, that you had acquainted me with your intention before you sent to inform the Baron I was here. I choose rather to lodge with you; and I propose to make amends for the trouble I shall give you. Pray, Sir, don't mention it, said the Peasant, you are as welcome as myself; I hope no offence; the only reason of my sending was, because I am both unable and unworthy to entertain your Honour. -I am sorry, said Sir Philip, you should think me so dainty; I am a Christian soldier; and him I acknowledge for my Prince and Master, accepted the invitations of the poor, and washed the feet of his disciples. Let us say no more on this head; I am resolved to stay this night in your cottage, tomorrow I will wait on the Baron, and thank him for his hospitable invitation. -That shall be as your Honour pleases, since you will condescend to stay here. John, do you run back and acquaint 
[Page 11]
my Lord of it. Not so, said Sir Philip; it is now almost dark. -'Tis no matter, said John, I can go it blindfold. Sir Philip then gave him a message to the Baron in his own name, acquainting him that he would pay his respects to him in the morning. John flew back the second time, and soon returned with new commendations from the Baron, and that he would expect him on the morrow. Sir Philip gave him an angel of gold, and praised his speed and abilities. 
He supped with Wyatt and his family upon new laid eggs and rashers of bacon, with the highest relish. They praised the Creator for his gifts, and acknowledged they were unworthy of the least of his blessings. They gave the best of their two lofts up to Sir Philip, the rest of the family slept in the other, the old woman and her daughter in the bed, the father and his two sons upon clean straw. Sir Philip's bed was of a better kind, and yet much inferior to hisusual accommodations; nevertheless the good Knight slept as well in Wyatt's cottage, as he could have done in a palace. 
During his sleep, many strange and incoherent dreams arose to his imagination. He thought he received a message from his friend Lord Lovel, to come to him at the Castle; that he stood at the gate and received him, that he strove to 
[Page 12]
embrace him, but could not; but that he spoke to this effect. -Though I have been dead these fifteen years, I still command here, and none can enter these gates without my permission; know that it is I that invite, and bid you welcome; the hopes of my house rest upon you. Upon this he bid Sir Philip follow him; he led him through many rooms, till at last he sunk down, and Sir Philip thought he still followed him, till he came into a dark and frightful cave, where he disappeared, and in his stead he beheld a complete suit of armour stained with blood, which belonged to his friend, and he thought he heard dismal groans from beneath. Presently after, he thought he was hurried away by an invisible hand, and led into a wild heath, where the people were inclosing the ground, and making preparations for two combatants; the trumpet sounded, and a voice called out still louder, Forbear! It is not permitted to be revealed till the time is ripe for the event: Wait with patience on the decrees of heaven. -He was then transported to his own house, where, going into an unfrequented room, he was again met by his friend, who was living, and in all the bloom of youth, as when he first knew him: He started at the sight, and awoke. The sun shone upon his curtains, and, perceiving it was day, he sat up, and recollected where he was. The 
[Page 13]
images that impressed his sleeping fancy remained strongly on his mind waking; but his reason strove to disperse them; it was natural that the story he had heard should create these ideas, that they should wait on him in his sleep, and that every dream should bear some relation to his deceased friend. The sun dazzled his eyes, the birds serenaded him and diverted his attention, and a woodbine forced its way through the window, and regaled his sense of smelling with its fragrance. -He arose, paid his devotions to Heaven, and then carefully descended the narrow stairs, and went out at the door of the cottage. There he saw the industrious wife and daughter of old Wyatt at their morning work, the one milking her cow, the other feeding her poultry. He asked for a draught of milk, which, with a slice of rye bread, served to break his fast. He walked about the fields alone; for old Wyatt and his two sons were gone out to their daily labour. He was soon called back by the good woman, who told him that a servant from the Baron waited to conduct him to the Castle. He took leave of Wyatt's wife, telling her he would see her again before he left the country. The daughter fetched his horse, which he mounted, and set forward with the servant, of whom he asked many questions concerning his master's family. How long have 
[Page 14]
you lived with the Baron? -Ten years. - Is he a good master? -Yes, Sir, and also a good husband and father. -What family has he? -Three sons and a daughter-What age are they of? -The eldest son is in his seventeenth year, the second in his sixteenth, the others several years younger; but beside these my Lord has several young gentlemen brought up with his own sons, two of which are his nephews; he keeps in his house a learned clerk to teach them languages; and as for all bodily exercises, none come near them; there is a fletcher to teach them the use of the cross bow; a master to teach them to ride; another the use of the sword; another learns them to dance; and then they wrestle and run, and have such activity in all their motions, that it does one good to see them; and my Lord thinks nothing too much to bestow on their education. Truly, says Sir Philip, he does the part of a good parent, and I honour him greatly for it; but are the young gentlemen of a promising disposition? -Yes indeed, Sir, answered the servant; the young gentlemen, my Lord's sons, are hopeful youths; but yet there is one who is thought to exceed them all, though he is the son of a poor labourer. -And who is he? said the knight. -One Edmund Twyford, the son of a cottager in our village; he is to be 
[Page 15]
sure as fine a youth as ever the sun shone upon, and of so sweet a disposition that nobody envies his good fortune. -What good fortune does he enjoy? -Why, Sir, about two years ago, my Lord, at his sons request, took him into his own family, and gives him the same education as his own children; the young Lords doat upon him, especially Master William, who is about his own age: It is supposed that he will attend the young Lords when they go to the wars, which my Lord intends they shall bye and bye. -What you tell me, said Sir Philip, increases every minute my respect for your Lord; he is an excellent father and master, he seeks out merit in obscurity, he distinguishes and rewards it: I honour him with all my heart. 
In this manner they conversed together till they came within view of the Castle. In a field near the house they saw a company of youths, with cross bows in their hands, shooting at a mark. There, said the servant, are our young gentlemen at their exercises. Sir Philip stopped his horse to observe them, he heard two or three of them cry out-Edmund is the victor! He wins the prize! I must, said Sir Philip, take a view of this Edmund-He jumped off his horse, gave the bridle to the servant, and walked into the field. The young gentlemen came up, and paid their respects to him; he apologized for 
[Page 16]
intruding upon their sports, and asked which was the victor? upon which the youth he spoke to beckoned to another, who immediately advanced, and made his obeisance: As he drew near, Sir Philip fixed his eyes upon him, with so much attention, that he seemed not to observe his courtesy and address. At length he recollected himself, and said, What is your name, young man? -Edmund Twyford, replied the youth; and I have the honour to attend upon the Lord Fitz-Owen's sons-Pray, noble Sir, said the youth who first addressed Sir Philip, are not you the stranger who is expected by my father? -I am, Sir, answered he, and I go to pay my respects to him. -Will you excuse our attendance, Sir? We have not yet finished our exercises. -My dear youth, said Sir Philip, no apology is necessary; but will you favour me with your proper name, that I may know to whose courtesy I am obliged? -My name is William Fitz-Owen; that Gentleman is my eldest brother, Master Robert; that other my kinsman, Master Richard Wenlock. -Very well; I thank you, gentle Sir; I beg you not to stir another step, your servant holds my horse. Farewell, Sir, said Master William; I hope we shall have the pleasure of meeting you at dinner. -The youths returned to their sports, and Sir Philip mounted his horse and proceeded to the Castle; 
[Page 17]
he entered it with a deep sigh, and melancholy recollections. The Baron received him with the utmost respect and courtesy. He gave a brief account of the principal events that had happened in the family of Lovel during his absence; he spoke of the late Lord Lovel with respect, of the present with the affection of a brother. Sir Philip, in return, gave a brief recital of his own adventures abroad, and of the disagreeable circumstances he had met with since his return home; he pathetically lamented the loss of all his friends, not forgetting that of his faithful servant on the way; saying he could be contented to give up the world, and retire to a religious house, but that he was withheld by the consideration, that some who depended entirely upon him, would want his presence and assistance; and, beside that, he thought he might be of service to many others. The Baron agreed with him in opinion, that a man was of much more service to the world who continued in it, than one who retired from it, and gave his fortune to the Church, whose servants did not always make the best use of it. Sir Philip then turned the conversation, and congratulated the Baron on his hopeful family; he praised their persons and address, and warmly applauded the care he bestowed on their education. The Baron listened with pleasure to the honest approbation 
[Page 18]
of a worthy heart, and enjoyed the true happiness of a parent. 
Sir Philip then made further enquiry concerning Edmund, whose appearance had struck him with an impression in his favour. That boy, said the Baron, is the son of a cottager in this neighbourhood; his uncommon merit, and gentleness of manners, distinguish him from those of his own class; from his childhood he attracted the notice and affection of all that knew him; he was beloved every where but at his father's house, and there it should seem that his merits were his crimes; for the Peasant, his father, hated him, treated him severely, and at length threatened to turn him out of doors; he used to run here and there on errands for my people, and at length they obliged me to take notice of him; my sons earnestly desired I would take him into my family; I did so about two years ago, intending to make him their servant; but his extraordinary genius and disposition have obliged me to look upon him in a superior light; perhaps I may incur the censure of many people, by giving him so many advantages, and treating him as the companion of my children: His merit must justify, or condemn, my partiality for him; however, I trust that I have secured to my children a faithful servant of the upper kind, and an useful friend to my family. 
[Page 19]
Sir Philip warmly applauded his generous host, and wished to be a sharer in his bounty to that fine youth, whose appearance indicated all the qualities that had endeared him to his companions. 
At the hour of dinner the young men presented themselves before their Lord, and his guest. Sir Philip addressed himself to Edmund; he asked him many questions, and received modest and intelligent answers, and he grew every minute more pleased with him. After dinner the youths withdrew with their tutor to pursue their studies. Sir Philip sat, for some time, wrapt up in meditation. After some minutes, the Baron asked him, if he might not be favoured with the fruits of his contemplations-You shall, my Lord, answered he, for you have a right to them. I was thinking, that when many blessings are lost, we should cherish those that remain, and even endeavour to replace the others-My Lord, I have taken a strong liking to that youth whom you call Edmund Twyford: I have neither children nor relations to claim my fortune, nor share my affections; your Lordship has many demands upon your generosity: I can provide for this promising youth without doing injustice to any one; will you give him to me? -He is a fortunate boy, said the Baron, to gain your favour so soon. -My Lord, said the Knight, I 
[Page 20]
will confess to you, that the first thing that touched my heart in his favour, is a strong resemblance he bears to a certain dear friend I once had, and his manner resembles him as much as his person; his qualities deserve that he should be placed in a higher rank; I will adopt him for my son, and introduce him into the world as my relation, if you will resign him to me: What say you? -Sir, said the Baron, you have made a noble offer, and I am too much the young man's friend to be a hindrance to his preferment. It is true that I intended to provide for him in my own family; but I cannot do it so effectually as by giving him to you, whose generous affection being unlimited by other ties, may in time prefer him to a higher station as he shall deserve it. I have only one condition to make; that the lad shall have his option; for I would not oblige him to leave my service against his inclination. -You say well, replied Sir Philip; nor would I take him upon other terms. - Agreed then, said the Baron; let us send for Edmund hither. A servant was sent to fetch him; he came immediately, and his Lord thus bespoke him. -Edmund, you owe eternal obligations to this gentleman, who, perceiving in you a certain resemblance to a friend of his, and liking your behaviour, has taken a great affection for you, insomuch that he desires to receive you 
[Page 21]
into his family: I cannot better provide for you than by disposing of you to him; and, if you have no objection, you shall return home with him when he goes from hence. The countenance of Edmund underwent many alterations during this proposal of his Lord; it expressed tenderness, gratitude, and sorrow, but the last was predominant; he bowed respectfully to the Baron and Sir Philip, and, after some hesitation, spoke as follows:-I feel very strongly the obligations I owe to this gentleman, for his noble and generous offer; I cannot express the sense I have of his goodness to me, a Peasant boy, only known to him by my Lord's kind and partial mention; this uncommon bounty claims my eternal gratitude. To you, my honoured Lord, I owe every thing, even this gentleman's good opinion -you distinguished me when nobody else did; and, next to you, your sons are my best and dearest benefactors; they introduced me to your notice. My heart is unalterably attached to this house and family, and my utmost ambition is to spend my life in your service: But if you have perceived any great and grievous faults in me, that make you wish to put me out of your family, and if you have recommended me to this gentleman in order to be rid of me, in that case I will submit to your pleasure, as I would if you should sentence me to death. 

[Page 22]
During this speech the tears made themselves channels down Edmund's cheeks; and his two noble auditors, catching the tender infection, wiped their eyes at the conclusion. My dear child, said the Baron, you overcome me by your tenderness and gratitude! I know of no faults you have committed, that I should wish to be rid of you: I thought to do you the best service by promoting you to that of Sir Philip Harclay, who is both able and willing to provide for you; but if you prefer my service to his, I will not part with you. Upon this Edmund kneeled to the Baron; he embraced his knees-My dear Lord! I am, and will be your servant, in preference to any man living; I only ask your permission to live and die in your service. -You see, Sir Philip, said the Baron, how this boy engages the heart; how can I part with him? - I cannot ask you any more, answered Sir Philip, I see it is impossible; but I esteem you both still higher than ever; the youth for his gratitude, and your Lordship for your noble mind and true generosity; blessings attend you both! -Oh, Sir, said Edmund, pressing the hand of Sir Philip, do not think me ungrateful to you, I will ever remember your goodness, and pray to Heaven to reward it; the name of Sir Philip Harclay shall be engraven upon my heart, next to my Lord and his family, for ever. Sir Philip 
[Page 23]
raised the youth and embraced him, saying, If ever you want a friend, remember me; and depend upon my protection, so long as you continue to deserve it. Edmund bowed low, and withdrew, with his eyes full of tears of sensibility and gratitude. When he was gone, Sir Philip said, I am thinking, that though young Edmund wants not my assistance at present, he may hereafter stand in need of my friendship. I should not wonder if such rare qualities as he possesses, should one day create envy, and raise him enemies; in which case he might come to lose your favour, without any fault of yours or his own. I am obliged to you for the warning, said the Baron, I hope it will be unnecessary; but if ever I part with Edmund, you shall have the refusal of him. I thank your Lordship for all your civilities to me, said the Knight; I leave my best wishes with you and your hopeful family, and I humbly take my leave. -Will you not stay one night in the Castle? returned my Lord; you shall be as welcome a guest as ever. - I acknowledge your goodness and hospitality, but this house fills me with melancholy recollections; I came hither with a heavy heart, and it will not be lighter while I remain here. I shall always remember your Lordship with the highest respect and esteem; and I pray God to preserve you, and increase your blessings! 

[Page 24]
After some further ceremonies, Sir Philip departed, and returned to old Wyatt's, ruminating on the vicissitude of human affairs, and thinking on the changes he had seen. 
At his return to Wyatt's cottage, he found the family assembled together. He told them he would take another night's lodging there, which they heard with great pleasure; for he had familiarised himself to them in the last evening's conversation, insomuch that they began to enjoy his company. He told Wyatt of the misfortune he had sustained by losing his servant on the way, and wished he could get one to attend him home in his place. Young John looked earnestly at his father, who returned a look of approbation. I perceive one in this company, said he, that would be proud to serve your Honour; but I fear he is not brought up well enough. John coloured with impatience, he could not forbear speaking. Sir, I can answer for an honest heart, a willing mind, and a light pair of heels; and though I am somewhat aukward, I shall be proud to learn, to please my noble Master, if he will but try me. You say well, said Sir Philip, I have observed your qualifications, and if you are desirous to serve me, I am equally pleased with you; if your father has no objection I will take you. Objection, Sir! said the old man; it will be my pride to prefer him to such a noble 
[Page 25]
gentleman; I will make no terms for him, but leave it to your Honour to do for him as he shall deserve. Very well, said Sir Philip, you shall be no loser by that; I will charge myself with the care of the young man. The bargain was struck, and Sir Philip purchased a horse for John of the old man. The next morning they set out; the Knight left marks of his bounty with the good couple, and departed, laden with their blessing and prayers. He stopped at the place where his faithful servant was buried, and caused masses to be said for the repose of his soul; then, pursuing his way by easy journeys, arrived in safety at home. His family rejoiced at his return; he settled his new servant in attendance upon his person; he then looked round his neighbourhood for objects of his charity; when he saw merit in distress, it was his delight to raise and support it: He spent his time in the service of his Creator, and glorified him in doing good to his creatures. He reflected frequently upon every thing that had befallen him in his late journey to the west; and, at his leisure, took down all the particulars in writing. 
Here follows an interval of four years, as by the manuscript; and this omission seems intended by the Writer. What follows is in a different hand, and the character is more modern. 

[Page 26]
About this time the prognostics of Sir Philip Harclay began to be verified, that Edmund's good qualities might one day excite envy and create him enemies. The sons and kinsmen of his patron began to seek occasion to find fault with him, and to depreciate him with others. The Baron's eldest son and heir, Master Robert, had several contests with Master William, the second son, upon his account: This youth had a warm affection for Edmund, and whenever his brother and kinsmen treated him slightly, he supported him against their malicious insinuations. Mr. Richard Wenlock, and Mr. John Markham, were the sisters sons of the Lord Fitz-Owen; and there were several other more distant relations, who, with them, secretly envied Edmund's fine qualities, and strove to lessen him in the esteem of the Baron and his family. By degrees they excited a dislike in Master Robert, that in time was fixed into habit, and sell little short of aversion. 
Young Wenlock's hatred was confirmed by an additional circumstance: He had a growing passion for the Lady Emma, the Baron's only daughter; and, as love is eagle-eyed, he saw, or fancied he saw her cast an eye of preference on Edmund. An accidental service that she received from him, had excited her grateful 
[Page 27]
regards and attentions towards him. The incessant view of his fine person and qualities, had perhaps improved her esteem into a still foster sensation, though she was yet ignorant of it, and thought it only the tribute due to gratitude and friendship. 
One Christmas time, the Baron and all his family went to visit a family in Wales; crossing a ford, the horse that carried the Lady Emma, who rode behind her cousin Wenlock, stumbled and fell down, and threw her off into the water: Edmund dismounted in a moment, and flew to her assistance; he took her out so quick, that the accident was not known to some part of the company. From this time Wenlock strove to undermine Edmund in her esteem, and she conceived herself obliged in justice and gratitude to defend him against the malicious insinuations of his enemies. She one day asked Wenlock, why he in particular should endeavour to recommend himself to her favour, by speaking against Edmund, to whom she was under great obligations? -He made but little reply; but the impression sunk deep into his rancorous heart; every word in Edmund's behalf was like a poisoned arrow that rankled in the wound, and grew every day more inflamed. Sometimes he would pretend to extenuate Edmund's supposed faults, in order 
[Page 28]
to load him with the sin of ingratitude upon other occasions. Rancour works deepest in the heart that strives to conceal it; and, when covered by art, frequently puts on the appearance of candour. By these means did Wenlock and Markham impose upon the credulity of Master Robert and their other relations: Master William only stood proof against all their insinuations. 
The same autumn that Edmund completed his eighteenth year, the Baron declared his intention of sending the young men of his house to France the following spring, to learn the art of war, and signalize their courage and abilities. 
Their ill-will towards Edmund was so well concealed, that his patron had not discovered it; but it was whispered among the servants, who are generally close observers of the manners of their principals. Edmund was a favourite with them all, which was a strong presumption that he deserved to be so, for they seldom shew much regard to dependents, or to superiour domestics, who are generally objects of envy and dislike. Edmund was courteous, but not familiar with them; and, by this means, gained their affections without soliciting them. Among them was an old serving man, called Joseph Howell; this man had formerly served 
[Page 29]
the old Lord Lovel, and his son; and when the young Lord died, and Sir Walter sold the castle to his brother-in-law, the Lord Fitz-Owen, he only of all the old servants was left in the house, to take care of it, and to deliver it into the possession of the new proprietor, who retained him in his service: He was a man of few words, but much reflection: and, without troubling himself about other people's affairs, went silently and properly about his own business; more solicitous to discharge his duty, than to recommend himself to notice, and not seeming to aspire to any higher office than that of a serving man. This old man would fix his eyes upon Edmund, whenever he could do it without observation; sometimes he would sigh deeply, and a tear would start from his eye, which he strove to conceal from observation. One day Edmund surprized him in this tender emotion, as he was wiping his eyes with the back of his hand: Why, said he, my good friend, do you look at me so eatnestly and affectionately? -Because I love you, Master Edmund, said he, because I wish you well. -I thank you kindly, answered Edmund; I am unable to repay your love, otherwise than by returning it, which I do sincerely. -I thank you, Sir, said the old man; that is all I desire, and more than I deserve. -Do not say so, said 
[Page 30]
Edmund; if I had any better way to thank you, I would not say so much about it; but words are all my inheritance. Upon this he shook hands with Joseph, who withdrew hastily to conceal his emotion, saying, God bless you, Master, and make your fortune equal to your deserts! I cannot help thinking you were born to a higher station than what you now hold. -You know to the contrary, said Edmund; but Joseph was gone out of sight and hearing. 
The notice and observation of strangers, and the affection of individuals, together with that inward consciousness that always attends superiour qualities, would sometimes kindle the flames of ambition in Edmund's heart; but he checked them presently by reflecting upon his low birth and dependant station. He was modest, yet intrepid; gentle and courteous to all; frank and unreserved to those that loved him, discreet and complaisant to those who hated him; generous and compassionate to the distresses of his fellow-creatures in general; humble, but not servile, to his patron and superiors. Once, when he with a manly spirit justified himself against a malicious imputation, his young Lord, Robert, taxed him with pride and arrogance to his kinsmen. Edmund denied the charge against him with 
[Page 31]
equal spirit and modesty. Master Robert answered him sharply-How dare you contradict my cousins? do you mean to give them the lye? -Not in words, Sir, said Edmund; but I will behave so as that you shall not believe them. Master Robert haughtily bade him be silent and know himself, and not presume to contend with men so much his superiors in every respect. These heart-burnings in some degree subsided by their preparations for going to France. Master Robert was to be presented at court before his departure, and it was expected that he should be knighted. The Baron designed Edmund to be his Esquire; but this was frustrated by his old enemies, who persuaded Robert to make choice of one of his own domestics, called Thomas-Hewson; him did they set up as a rival to Edmund, and he took every occasion to affront him. All that Master Robert gained by this step, was the contempt of those, who saw Edmund's merit, and thought it want of discernment in him not to distinguish and reward it. -Edmund requested of his Lord that he might be Master William's attendant; and when, said he, my patron shall be knighted, as I make no doubt he will one day be, he has promised that I shall be his Esquire. The Baron granted Edmund's request; and, being freed from servitude to the rest, he was 
[Page 32]
devoted to that of his beloved Master William, who treated him in public as his principal domestic, but in private as his chosen friend and brother. 
The whole cabal of his enemies consulted together in what manner they should vent their resentment against him; and it was agreed that they should treat him with indifference and neglect, till they should arrive in France; and when there, they should contrive to render his courage suspected, and by putting him upon some desperate enterprize, rid themselves of him for ever. About this time died the great Duke of Bedford, to the irreparable loss of the English nation. He was succeeded by Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York, as Regent of France, of which great part had revolted to Charles the Dauphin. Frequent actions ensued. Cities were lost and won; and continual occasions offered to exercise the courage, and abilities, of the youth of both nations. 
The young men of Baron Fitz-Owen's house were recommended particularly to the Regent's notice. Master Robert was knighted, with several other young men of family, who distinguished themselves by their spirit and activity upon every occasion. The youth were daily employed in warlike exercises, and frequent actions; and made their first essay in arms in 
[Page 33]
such a manner as to bring into notice all that deserved it. 
Various arts were used by Edmund's enemies to expose him to danger; but all their contrivances recoiled upon themselves, and brought increase of honour upon Edmund's head: He distinguished himself upon so many occasions, that Sir Robert himself began to pay him more than ordinary regard, to the infinite mortification of his kinsmen and relations. They laid many schemes against him, but none took effect. 
From this place the characters in the manuscript are effaced by time and damp. Here and there some sentences are legible, but not sufficient to pursue the thread of the story. Mention is made of several actions in which the young men were engaged- that Edmund distinguished himself by intrepidity in action; by gentleness, humanity and modesty in the cessations-that he attracted the notice of every person of observation, and also that he received personal commendation from the Regent. 
The following incidents are clear enough to be transcribed; but the beginning of the next succeeding pages is obliterated: However, we may guess at the beginning by what remains. 

[Page 34]
* * * * * * * * * * *
As soon as the cabal met in Sir Robert's tent, Mr. Wenlock thus began. You see, my friends, that every attempt we make to humble this upstart, turns into applause, and serves only to raise his pride still higher. Something must be done, or his praise will go home before us, at our own expence; and we shall seem only soils to set off his glories. Any thing would I give to the man who should execute our vengeance upon him. Stop there, cousin Wenlock, said Sir Robert; though I think Edmund proud and vain-glorious, and would join in any scheme to humble him, and make him know himself, I will not suffer any man to use such base methods to effect it. Edmund is brave; and it is beneath an Englishman to revenge himself by unworthy means; if any such are used, I will be the first man to bring the guilty to justice; and if I hear another word to this purpose, I will inform my brother William, who will acquaint Edmund with your mean intentions. Upon this the cabal drew back, and Mr. Wenlock protested that he meant no more than to mortify his pride, and make him know his proper station. Soon after Sir Robert withdrew, and they resumed their deliberations. 

[Page 35]
Then spoke Thomas Hewson: There is a party to be sent out to-morrow night, to intercept a convoy of provisions for the relief of Rouen; I will provoke Mr. Edmund to make one of this party, and when he is engaged in the action, I and my companions will draw off, and leave him to the enemy, who I trust will so handle him, that you shall no more be troubled with him. This will do, said Mr. Wenlock; but let it be kept from my two cousins, and only known to ourselves; if they offer to be of the party, I will persuade them off it: And you, Thomas, if you bring this scheme to a conclusion, may depend upon my eternal gratitude. -And mine, said Markham; and so said all. The next day the affair was publicly mentioned; and Hewson, as he promised, provoked Edmund to the trial: Several young men of family offered themselves; among the rest, Sir Robert, and his brother William. Mr. Wenlock persuaded them not to go, and set the danger of the enterprize in the strongest colours. At last Sir Robert complained of the tooth ach, and was confined to his tent; Edmund waited on him; and judging by the ardour of his own courage of that of his patron, thus bespoke him. I am greatly concerned, dear Sir, that we cannot have your company at night; but as I know what you will suffer in being absent, I would beg the favour of you to 
[Page 36]
let me use your arms and device, and I will promise not to disgrace them. No, Edmund, I cannot consent to that: I thank you for your noble offer, and will remember it to your advantage; but I cannot wear honours of another man's getting. You have awakened me to a sense of my duty: I will go with you, and contend with you for glory; and William shall do the same. 
In a few hours they were ready to set out. Wenlock and Markham, and their dependants, found themselves engaged in honour to go upon an enterprize they never intended; and set out, with heavy hearts, to join the party. They marched in silence in the horrors of a dark night, and wet roads; they met the convoy where they expected, and a sharp engagement ensued. The victory was some time doubtful; but the moon rising on the backs of the English, gave them the advantage. They saw the disposition of their enemies, and availed themselves of it. Edmund advanced the foremost of the party; he drew out the leader on the French side; he slew him. Mr. William pressed forward to assist his friend; Sir Robert, to defend his brother; Wenlock, and Markham, from shame to stay behind. 
Thomas Hewson and his associates drew back on their side; the French perceived it, 
[Page 37]
and pursued the advantage. Edmund pushed them in front; the young nobles all followed him; they broke through the detachment, and stopped the waggons. The officer who commanded the party, encouraged them to go on; the defeat was soon complete, and the provisions carried in triumph to the English camp. 
Edmund was presented to the Regent, as the man to whom the victory was chiefly owing. Not a tongue presumed to move itself against him; even malice and envy were silenced. 
Approach, young man, said the Regent, that I may confer upon you the honour of knighthood, which you have well deserved. Mr. Wenlock could no longer forbear speaking: Knighthood, said he, is an order belonging to gentlemen, it cannot be conferred on a peasant. What say you, Sir! returned the Regent; is this youth a peasant? -He is, said Wenlock; let him deny it if he can. Edmund, with a modest bow, replied, It is true indeed I am a peasant, and this honour is too great for me: I have only done my duty. The Duke of York, whose pride of birth equalled that of any man living or dead, sheathed his sword immediately. Though, said he, I cannot reward you as I intended, I will take care that you shall have a large share in the spoils of this night; and, I 
[Page 38]
declare publicly, that you stand first in the list of gallant men in this engagement. 
Thomas Hewson and his associates made a poor figure in their return; they were publicly reproved for their backwardness. Hewson was wounded in body and more in mind, for the bad success of his ill-laid design. He could not hold up his head before Edmund; who, unconscious of their malice, administered every kind of comfort to them. He spoke in their behalf to the commanding officer, imputing their conduct to unavoidable accidents. He visited them privately; he gave them a part of the spoils allotted to himself; by every act of valour and courtesy he strove to engage those hearts that hated, envied, and maligned him: But where hatred arises from envy of superior qualities, every display of those qualities increases the cause from whence it arises. 
Another pause ensues here. 
The young nobles and gentlemen who distinguished Edmund, were prevented from raising him to preferment by the insinuations of Wenlock and his associates, who never failed to set before them his low descent, and his pride and arrogance in presuming to rank with gentlemen. 

[Page 39]
Here the manuscript is not legible for several pages. There is mention, about this time, of the death of the Lady Fitz-Owen; but not the cause. 
Wenlock rejoiced to find that his schemes took effect, and that they should be recalled at the approach of winter. The Baron was glad of a pretence to send for them home; for he could no longer endure the absence of his children, after the loss of their mother. 
The manuscript is again defaced for many leaves; at length the letters become more legible, and the remainder of it is quite perfect. 

[Page 40]
From the time the young men returned from France, the enemies of Edmund employed their utmost abilities to ruin him in the Baron's opinion, and get him dismissed from the family. They insinuated a thousand things against him, that happened, as they said, during his residence in France, and therefore could not be known to his master; but when the Baron privately enquired of his two elder sons, he found there was no truth in their reports. Sir Robert, though he did not love him, scorned to join in untruths against him. Mr. William spoke of him with the warmth of fraternal affection. The Baron perceived that his kinsmen disliked Edmund; but his own good heart hindered him from seeing the baseness of theirs. It is said, that continual dropping will wear away a stone; so did their incessant reports, by insensible degrees, produce a coolness in his patron's behaviour towards him. If he behaved with manly spirit, it was misconstrued into pride and arrogance; his generosity was imprudence; his humility was hypocrisy, the better to cover his ambition. Edmund bore patiently all the indignities that were thrown upon him; and, though he felt them severely in his bosom, scorned to justify his conduct at the expence even of his enemies. Perhaps his gentle spirit might at length have sunk under this treatment, 
[Page 41]
but providence interposed in his behalf; and, by seemingly accidental circumstances, conducted him imperceptibly towards the crisis of his fate. 
Father Oswald, who had been preceptor to the young men, had a strong affection for Edmund, from a thorough knowledge of his heart; he saw through the mean artifices that were used to undermine him in his patron's favour; he watched their machinations, and strove to frustrate their designs. 
This good man used frequently to walk out with Edmund; they conversed upon various subjects; and the youth would lament to him the unhappiness of his situation, and the peculiar circumstances that attended him. The father, by his wholesome advice, comforted his drooping heart, and confirmed him in his resolution of bearing unavoidable evils with patience and fortitude, from the consciousness of his own innocence, and the assurance of a future and eternal reward. 
One day, as they were walking in a wood near the castle, Edmund asked the father, what meant those preparations for building, the cutting down trees, and burning of bricks? -What, said Oswald, have you not heard that my Lord is going to build a new apartment on the west side of the castle? -And why, said Edmund, 
[Page 42]
should my Lord be at that expence when there is one on the east side that is never occupied? - That apartment, said the friar, you must have observed is always shut up. I have observed it often, said Edmund; but I never presumed to ask any questions about it. -You had then, said Oswald, less curiosity, and more discretion, than is common at your age. -You have raised my curiosity, said Edmund; and, if it be not improper, I beg of you to gratify it. -We are alone, said Oswald, and I am so well assured of your prudence, that I will explain this mystery in some degree to you. 
You must know, that apartment was occupied by the last Lord Lovel when he was a batchelor. He married in his father's life-time, who gave up his own apartment to him, and offered to retire to this himself; but the son would not permit him; he chose to sleep here, rather than in any other. He had been married about three months, when his father, the old Lord, died of a fever. About twelve months after his marriage, he was called upon to attend the King, Henry the Fourth, on an expedition into Wales, whither he was attended by many of his dependants. He left his lady big with child, and full of care and anxiety for his safety and return. 

[Page 43]
After the King had chastised the Rebels, and obtained the victory, the Lord Lovel was expected home every day; various reports were sent home before him; one messenger brought an account of his health and safety-soon after another came with bad news, that he was slain in battle. His kinsman, Sir Walter Lovel, came here on a visit to comfort the Lady; and he waited to receive his kinsman at his return. It was he that brought the news of the sad event of the battle to the Lady Lovel. 
She fainted away at the relation; but, when she revived, exerted the utmost resolution; saying, it was her duty to bear this dreadful stroke with christian fortitude and patience, especially in regard to the child she went with, the last remains of her beloved husband, and the undoubted heir of a noble house. For several days she seemed an example of patience and resignation; but then, all at once, she renounced them, and broke out into passionate and frantic exclamations; she said, that her dear Lord was basely murdered; that his ghost had appeared to her, and revealed his fate: She called upon Heaven and earth to revenge her wrongs; saying, she would never cease complaining to God, and the King, for vengeance and justice. 
Upon this, Sir Walter told the servants that Lady Lovel was distracted, from grief for the 
[Page 44]
death of her Lord; that his regard for her was as strong as ever; and that, if she recovered, he would himself be her comforter, and marry her. In the mean time she was confined in this very apartment, and in less than a month the poor Lady died. -She lies buried in the family vault in St. Austin's church in the village. Sir Walter took possession of the Castle, and all the other estates, and assumed the title of Lord Lovel. 
Soon after, it was reported that the Castle was haunted, and that the ghosts of Lord and Lady Lovel had been seen by several of the servants. Whoever went into this apartment were terrified by uncommon noises, and strange appearances; at length this apartment was wholly shut up, and the servants were forbid to enter it, or to talk of any thing relating to it: However, the story did not stop here; it was whispered about, that the new Lord Lovel was so disturbed every night, that he could not sleep in quiet; and, being at last tired of the place, he sold the Castle and estate of his ancestors, to his brother-in-law the Lord Fitz-Owen, who now enjoys it, and left this country. 
All this is news to me, said Edmund; but, father, tell me what grounds there were for the Lady's suspicion that her Lord died unfairly. - Alas! said Oswald, that is only known to God. 
[Page 45]
There were strange thoughts in the minds of many at that time; I had mine; but I will not disclose them, not even to you. I will not injure those who may be innocent; and I leave it to Providence, who will doubtless, in its own best time and manner, punish the guilty. But let what I have told you be as if you had never heard it. 
I thank you for these marks of your esteem and confidence, said Edmund; be assured that I will not abuse them; nor do I desire to pry into secrets not proper to be revealed: I entirely approve your discretion, and acquiesce in your conclusion, that Providence will in its own time vindicate its ways to man: If it were not for that trust, my situation would be insupportable. I strive earnestly to deserve the esteem and favour of good men; I endeavour to regulate my conduct so as to avoid giving offence to any man; but I see, with infinite pain, that it is impossible for me to gain these points-I see it too, with great concern, said Oswald; and every thing that I can say and do in your favour is misconstrued; and, by seeking to do you service, I lose my own influence: But I will never give my sanction to acts of injustice, nor join to oppress innocence. My dear child, put your trust in God: He who brought light out of 
[Page 46]
darkness, can bring good out of evil. -I hope and trust so, said Edmund; but, father, if my enemies should prevail, if my Lord should believe their stories against me, and I should be put out of the house with disgrace, what will become of me? I have nothing but my character to depend upon; if I lose that, I lose every thing; and I see they seek no less than my ruin. -Trust in my Lord's honour and justice, replied Oswald; he knows your virtue, and he is not ignorant of their ill-will towards you. -I know my Lord's justice too well to doubt it, said Edmund; but would it not be better to rid him of this trouble, and his family of an incumbrance? I would gladly do something for myself, but cannot without my Lord's recommendation; and, such is my situation, that I fear the asking for a dismission would be accounted base ingratitude: Beside, when I think of leaving this house, my heart saddens at the thought, and tells me I cannot be happy out of it: Yet I think I could return to a peasant's life with cheerfulness, rather than live in a palace under disdain and contempt. -Have patience a little longer, my son, said Oswald; I will think of some way to serve you, and to represent your grievances to my Lord, without offence to either: Perhaps the causes may be removed. Continue to observe the same 
[Page 47]
irreproachable conduct; and be assured that Heaven will defend your innocence, and defeat the unjust designs of your enemies. Let us now return home. 
About a week after this conference, Edmund walked out in the fields ruminating on the disagreeable circumstances of his situation. Insensible of the time, he had been out several hours without perceiving how the day wore away, when he heard himself called by name several times; looking backward, he saw his friend Mr. William, and hallooed to him. He came running towards him; and, leaping over the style, stood still a while to recover his breath. What is the matter, Sir? said Edmund; your looks bespeak some tidings of importance. With a look of tender concern and affection, the youth pressed his hand and spoke. My dear Edmund, you must come home with me directly; your old enemies have united to ruin you with my father; my brother Robert has declared that he thinks there will be no peace in our family till you are dismissed from it, and told my father, he hoped he would not break with his kinsmen rather than give up Edmund. -But what do they lay to my charge? said Edmund. -I cannot rightly understand, answered William, for they make a great mystery of it; something of 
[Page 48]
great consequence, they say; but they will not tell me what: However, my father has told them that they must bring their accusation before your face, and he will have you answer them publicly. I have been seeking you this hour, to inform you of this, that you might be prepared to defend yourself against your accusers. - God reward you, Sir, said Edmund, for all your goodness to me! I see they are determined to ruin me if possible: I shall be compelled to leave the Castle; but, whatever becomes of me, be assured you shall have no cause to blush for your kindness and partiality to your Edmund. - I know it, I am sure of it, said William; and here I swear to you, as Jonathan did to David, I beseech Heaven to bless me, as my friendship to you shall be steady and inviolable! -Only so long as I shall deserve so great a blessing, interrupted Edmund. -I know your worth and honour, continued William; and such is my confidence in your merit, that I firmly believe Heaven designs you for something extraordinary; and I expect that some great and unforeseen event will raise you to the rank and station to which you appear to belong: Promise me, therefore, that whatever may be your fate you will preserve the same friendship for me that I bear to you. - Edmund was so much affected that he could not 
[Page 49]
answer but in broken sentences. Oh my friend, my master! I vow, I promise, my heart promises! -He kneeled down with clasped hands, and uplifted eyes: William kneeled by him, and they invoked the Supreme to witness to their friendship, and implored his blessing upon it: They then rose up and embraced each other, while tears of cordial affection bedewed their cheeks. 
As soon as they were able to speak, Edmund conjured his friend not to expose himself to the displeasure of his family out of kindness to him. I submit to the will of Heaven, said he, I wait with patience its disposal of me; if I leave the Castle, I will find means to inform you of my fate and fortunes. -I hope, said William, that things may yet be accommodated; but do not take any resolution, let us act as occasions arise. 
In this manner these amiable youths conferred, till they arrived at the Castle. The Baron was sitting in the great hall, on a high chair with a footstep before, with the state and dignity of a judge; before him stood father Oswald, as pleading the cause for himself and Edmund. Round the Baron's chair stood his eldest son and his kinsmen, with their principal domestics. The old servant, Joseph, at some distance, with his head leaning forward, as listening with the utmost attention to what passed. 
[Page 50]
Mr. William approached the chair. -My Lord, I have found Edmund, and brought him to answer for himself. -You have done well, said the Baron. Edmund, come hither; you are charged with some indiscretions, for I cannot properly call them crimes: I am resolved to do justice between you and your accusers; I shall therefore hear you as well as them; for no man ought to be condemned unheard. -My Lord, said Edmund, with equal modesty and intrepidity, I demand my trial; if I shall be found guilty of any crimes against my Benefactor, let me be punished with the utmost rigour: But if, as I trust, no such charge can be proved against me, I know your goodness too well to doubt that you will do justice to me, as well as to others; and if it should so happen that by the misrepresentations of my enemies (who have long sought my ruin privately, and now avow it publicly), if by their artifices your Lordship should be induced to think me guilty, I would submit to your sentence in silence, and appeal to another tribunal. -See, said Mr. Wenlock, the confidence of the fellow! he already supposes that my Lord must be in the wrong if he condemns him; and then this meek creature will appeal to another tribunal: To whose will he appeal? I desire he may be made to explain himself. - That I will immediately, said Edmund, without 
[Page 51]
being compelled; I only meant to appeal to Heaven that best knows my innocence. -'Tis true, said the Baron, and no offence to any one; man can only judge by appearances, but Heaven knows the heart: Let every one of you bear this in mind, that you may not bring a false accusation, nor justify yourselves by concealing the truth. Edmund, I am informed that Oswald and you have made very free with me and my family, in some of your conversations; you were heard to censure me for the absurdity of building a new apartment on the west side of the Castle, when there was one on the east side uninhabited: Oswald said, that apartment was shut up because it was haunted; that some shocking murther had been committed there; adding many particulars concerning Lord Lovel's family, such as he could not know the truth of, and, if he had known, was imprudent to reveal. But, further, you complained of ill treatment here; and mentioned an intention to leave the Castle, and seek your fortune elsewhere. I shall examine into all these particulars in turn. At present I desire you, Edmund, to relate all that you can remember of the conversation that passed between you and Oswald in the wood last Monday. - Good God! said Edmund, is it possible that any person could put such a construction upon so innocent a conversation? 

[Page 52]
Tell me then, said the Baron, the particulars of it. -I will, my Lord, as nearly as my memory will allow me. Accordingly he related most of the conversation that passed in the wood; but, in the part that concerned the family of Lovel, he abbreviated as much as possible. Oswald's countenance cleared up, for he had done the same before Edmund came. The Baron called to his eldest son,-You hear, Sir Robert, what both parties say: I have questioned them separately; neither of them knew what the other would answer, yet their accounts agree almost to a word. -I confess they do so, answered Sir Robert; but, Sir, it is very bold and presuming for them to speak of our family affairs in such a manner; if my uncle, Lord Lovel, should come to know it, he would punish them severely; and, if his honour is reflected upon, it becomes us to resent and to punish it. Here Mr. Wenlock broke out into passion, and offered to swear to the truth of his accusation. Be silent, Dick, said the Baron; I shall judge for myself. I protest, said he to Sir Robert, I never heard so much as Oswald has now told me concerning the deaths of Lord and Lady Lovel; I think it is best to let such stories alone till they die away of themselves. I had, indeed, heard of an idle story of the east apartment's being haunted, when first I came hither, and 
[Page 53]
my brother advised me to shut it up till it should be forgotten; but what has now been said, has suggested a thought that may make that apartment useful in future. I have thought of a punishment for Edmund that will stop the mouth of his accusers for the present; and, as I hope, will establish his credit with every body. Edmund, will you undertake this adventure for me? -What adventure, my Lord, said Edmund? There is nothing I would not undertake to shew my gratitude and fidelity to you. As to my courage, I would shew that at the expence of my malicious accusers, if respect to my Lord's blood did not tie up my hands; as I am situated, I beg it may be put to the proof in whatever way is most for my master's service. -That is well said, cried the Baron: As to your enemies, I am thinking how to separate you from them effectually; of that I shall speak hereafter. I am going to try Edmund's courage; he shall sleep three nights in the east apartment, that he may testify to all whether it be haunted or not; afterwards I will have that apartment set in order, and my eldest son shall take it for his own; it will spare me some expence, and answer my purpose as well, or better: Will you consent, Edmund? -With all my heart, my Lord, said Edmund, I have not wilfully offended God or 
[Page 54]
man; I have, therefore, nothing to fear. -Brave boy! said my Lord; I am not deceived in you, nor shall you be deceived in your reliance on me. You shall sleep in that apartment to-night, and to-morrow I will have some private talk with you. Do you, Oswald, go with me; I want to have some conversation with you. The rest of you, retire to your studies and bufiness; I will meet you at dinner. 
Edmund retired to his own chamber, and Oswald was shut up with the Baron; he defended Edmund's cause and his own, and laid open as much as he knew of the malice and designs of his enemies. The Baron expressed much concern at the untimely deaths of Lord and Lady Lovel, and desired Oswald to be circumspect in regard to what he had to say of the circumstances attending them; adding, that the was both innocent and ignorant of any treachery towards either of them. Oswald excused himself for his communications to Edmund, saying, they fell undesignedly into the subject, and that he mentioned it in confidence to him only. 
The Baron sent orders to the young men to come to dinner; but they refused to meet Edmund at table; accordingly he ate in the steward's apartment. After dinner, the Baron tried to reconcile his kinsmen to Edmund; but found it 
[Page 55]
impossible. They saw their designs were laid open; and, judging of him by themselves, thought it impossible to forgive or be forgiven. The Baron ordered them to keep in separate apartments; he took his eldest son for his own companion, as being the most reasonable of the malecontents; and ordered his kinsmen to keep their own apartment, with a servant to watch their motions. Mr. William had Oswald for his companion. Old Joseph was bid to attend on Edmund; to serve him at supper; and, at the hour of nine, to conduct him to the haunted apartment. Edmund desired that he might have a light and his sword, lest his enemies should endeavour to surprise him. The Baron thought his request reasonable, and complied with it. 
There was a great search to find the key of the apartment; at last it was discovered by Edmund, himself, among a parcel of old rusty keys in a lumber room. The Baron sent the young men their suppers to their respective apartments. Edmund declined eating, and desired to be conducted to his apartment. He was accompanied by most of the servants to the door of it; they wished him success, and prayed for him as if he had been going to execution. 
The door was with great difficulty unlocked, and Joseph gave Edmund a lighted lamp, and 
[Page 56]
wished him a good night; he returned his good wishes to them all with the utmost cheerfulness, took the key on the inside of the door, and dismissed them. 
He then took a survey of his chamber; the furniture, by long neglect, was decayed and dropping to pieces; the bed was devoured by the moths, and occupied by the rats, who had built their nests there with impunity for many generations. The bedding was very damp, for the rain had forced its way through the cieling; he determined, therefore, to lie down in his clothes. There were two doors on the further side of the room, with keys in them; being not at all sleepy, he resolved to examine them; he attempted one lock, and opened it with ease; he went into a large dining-room, the furniture of which was in the same tattered condition; out of this was a large closet with some books in it, and hung round with coats of arms, with genealogies and alliances of the house of Lovel; he amused himself here some minutes, and then returned into the bed-chamber. 
He recollected the other door, and resolved to see where it led to; the key was rusted into the lock, and resisted his attempts; he set the lamp on the ground, and, exerting all his strength, opened the door, and at the same instant 
[Page 57]
the wind of it blew out the lamp, and left him in utter darkness. At the same moment he heard a hollow rustling noise, like that of a person coming through a narrow passage. Till this moment not one idea of fear had approached the mind of Edmund; but, just then, all the concurrent circumstances of his fituation struck upon his heart, and gave him a new and disagreeable sensation. He paused a while; and, recollecting himself, cried out aloud-What should I fear? I have not wilfully offended God or man; why then should I doubt protection? But I have not yet implored the divine assistance; how then can I expect it! Upon this, he kneeled down and prayed earnestly, resigning himself wholly to the will of heaven; while he was yet speaking, his courage returned, and he resumed his usual confidence; again he approached the door from whence the noise proceeded; he thought he saw a glimmering light upon a staircase before him. If, said he, this apartment is haunted, I will use my endeavours to discover the cause of it; and if the spirit appears visibly, I will speak to it. 
He was preparing to descend the staircase, when he heard several knocks at the door by which he first entered the room; and, stepping backward, the door was clapped to with great violence. Again fear attacked him, but he 
[Page 58]
resisted it, and boldly cried out-Who is there? -A voice at the outer door answered,-It's I- Joseph, your friend! -What do you want? said Edmund-I have brought you some wood to make a fire, said Joseph. -I thank you kindly, said Edmund; but my lamp is gone out; I will try to find the door, however. After some trouble he found, and opened it; and was not sorry to see his friend Joseph, with a light in one hand, a flagon of beer in the other, and a fagot upon his shoulder. I come, said the good old man, to bring you something to keep up your spirits; the evening is cold; I know this room wants airing; and beside that, my Master, I think your present undertaking requires a little assistance. 
My good friend, said Edmund, I never shall be able to deserve or requite your kindness to me. -My dear Sir, you always deserved more than I could do for you; and I think I shall yet live to see you defeat the designs of your enemies, and acknowledge the services of your friends-Alas! said Edmund, I see little prospect of that!-I see, said Joseph, something that persuades me you are designed for great things; and I perceive that things are working about to some great end: Have courage, my Master, my heart beats strangely high upon your account! -You make me smile, said Edmund. 
[Page 59]
-I am glad to see it, Sir; may you smile all the rest of your life! I thank your honest affection, returned Edmund, though it is too partial to me. You had better go to bed, however; if it is known that you visit me here, it will be bad for us both. -So I will presently; but, please God, I will come here again to-morrow night, when all the family are a-bed; and I will tell you some things that you never yet heard. -But pray tell me, said Edmund, where does that door lead to? -Upon a passage that ends in a staircase that leads to the lower rooms; and there is likewise a door out of that passage into the dining-room. -And what rooms are there below stairs, said Edmund? -The same as above, replied he. -Very well; then I wish you a good night, we will talk further to-morrow. -Aye, to-morrow night; and in this place, my dear Master. -Why do you call me your Master? I never was, nor ever can be, your Master. -God only knows that, said the good old man; good night, and heaven bless you! - Good night, my worthy friend! 
Joseph withdrew, and Edmund returned to the other door, and attempted several times to open it in vain; his hands were benumbed and tired; at length he gave over. He made a fire in the chimney, placed the lamp on a table, and opened one of the window-shutters to admit 
[Page 60]
the day-light; he then recommended himself to the divine protection, and threw himself upon the bed; he presently sell asleep, and continued in that state, till the sun saluted him with his orient beams through the window he had opened. 
As soon as he was perfectly awake, he strove to recollect his dreams. He thought that he heard people coming up the staircase that he had a glimpse of; that the door opened, and there entered a Warrior, leading a Lady by the hand, who was young and beautiful, but pale and wan: The man was dressed in complete armour, and his helmet down. They approached the bed; they undrew the curtains. He thought the man said,-Is this our child? The woman replied,-It is; and the hour approaches that he shall be known for such. They then separated, and one stood on each side of the bed; their hands met over his head, and they gave him a solemn benediction. He strove to rise and pay them his respects, but they forbad him; and the Lady said,-Sleep in peace, oh my Edmund! for those who are the true possessors of this apartment are employed in thy preservation: Sleep on, sweet hope of a house that is thought past hope! -Upon this, they withdrew, and went out at the same door by which they entered, and he heard them descend the stairs. -After this, he followed 
[Page 61]
a funeral as chief mourner; he saw the whole procession, and heard the ceremonies performed. He was snatched away from this mournful scene to one of a contrary kind, a stately feast, at which he presided; and he heard himself congratulated as a husband, and a father: His friend William sat by his side; and his happiness was complete. Every succeeding idea was happiness without allay; and his mind was not idle a moment till the morning sun awakened him. He perfectly remembered his dreams, and meditated on what all these things should portend. Am I then, said he, not Edmund Twyford, but somebody of consequence in whose fate so many people are interested? Vain thought, that must have arisen from the partial suggestion of my two friends, Mr. William and old Joseph! 
He lay thus reflecting, when a servant knocked at his door, and told him it was past six o'clock, and that the Baron expected him to breakfast in an hour. He rose immediately; paid his tribute of thanks to heaven for its protection, and went from his chamber in high health and spirits. 
He walked in the garden till the hour of breakfast, and then attended the Baron. Good morrow, Edmund! said he; how have you rested in your new apartment? Extremely well, my Lord, answered he. -I am glad to hear it, said the Baron; but I did not know your accommodations 
[Page 62]
were so bad, as Joseph tells me they are. -'Tis of no consequence, said Edmund; if they were much worse, I could dispense with them for three nights. -Very well, said the Baron; you are a brave lad: I am satisfied with you, and will excuse the other two nights. -But, my Lord, I will not be excused; no one shall have reason to suspect my courage: I am determined to go through the remaining nights upon many accounts. -That shall be as you please, said my Lord. I think of you as you deserve; so well, that I shall ask your advice by and by in some affairs of consequence. -My life and services are yours, my Lord; command them freely. - Let Oswald be called in, said my Lord; he shall be one of our consultation. He came; the servants were dismissed; and the Baron spoke as follows. Edmund, when first I took you into my family, it was at the request of my sons and kinsmen; I bear witness to your good behaviour, you have not deserved to lose their esteem; but, nevertheless, I have observed for some years past, that all but my son William have set their faces against you: I see their meanness, and I perceive their motives: But they are, and must be, my relations; and I would rather govern them by love, than fear. I love and esteem your virtues: I cannot give you up to gratify their humours. My son William has 
[Page 63]
lost the affections of the rest, for that he bears to you; but he has increased my regard for him: I think myself bound in honour to him and you to provide for you; I cannot do it, as I wished, under my own roof. If you stay here, I see nothing but confusion in my family; yet I cannot put you out of it disgracefully. I want to think of some way to prefer you, that you may leave this house with honour; and I desire both of you to give me your advice in this matter. If Edmund will tell me in what way I can employ him to his own honour and my advantage, I am ready to do it; let him propose it, and Oswald shall moderate between us. 
Here he stopped; and Edmund, whose sighs almost choaked him, threw himself at the Baron's feet, and wet his hand with his tears. Oh, my noble, generous benefactor! do you condescend to consult such a one as me upon the state of your family? does your most amiable and beloved son incur the ill-will of his brothers and kinsmen for my sake? What am I, that I should disturb the peace of this noble family? Oh, my Lord, send me away directly! I should be unworthy to live, if I did not earnestly endeavour to restore your happiness. You have given me a noble education, and I trust I shall not disgrace it. If you will recommend me, and give me a character, I fear not 
[Page 64]
to make my own fortune. The Baron wiped his eyes; I wish to do this, my child, but in what way? -My Lord, said Edmund, I will open my heart to you. I have served with credit in the army, and I should prefer a soldier's life. -You please me well, said the Baron: I will send you to France, and give you a recommendation to the Regent; he knows you personally, and will prefer you, for my sake, and for your own merit. -My Lord, you overwhelm me with your goodness! I am but your creature, and my life shall be devoted to your service. -But, said the Baron, how to dispose of you till the spring? -That, said Oswald, may be thought of at leisure; I am glad that you have resolved, and I congratulate you both. The Baron put an end to the conversation by desiring Edmund to go with him into the Manege to see his horses. He ordered Oswald to acquaint his son William with all that had passed, and to try to persuade the young men to meet Edmund and William at dinner. 
The Baron took Edmund with him into his Manege to see some horses he had lately purchased; while they were examining the beauties and defects of these noble and useful animals, Edmund declared that he preferred Caradoc, a horse he had broke himself, to any other in my Lord's stables. Then, said the Baron, 
[Page 65]
I will give him to you; and you shall go upon him to seek your fortune. He made new acknowledgments for this gift, and declared he would prize it highly for the giver's sake. But I shall not part with you yet, said my Lord; I will first carry all my points with these saucy boys, and oblige them to do you justice. - You have already done that, said Edmund; and I will not suffer any of your Lordship's blood to undergo any farther humiliation upon my account. I think, with humble submission to your better judgment, the sooner I go hence the better. 
While they were speaking, Oswald came to them, and said, that the young men had absolutely refused to dine at the table, if Edmund was present. 'Tis well, said the Baron; I shall find a way to punish their contumacy hereafter: I will make them know that I am the master here. Edmund and you, Oswald, shall spend the day in my apartment above stairs. William shall dine with me alone; and I will acquaint him with our determination: My son Robert, and his cabal, shall be prisoners in the great parlour. Edmund shall, according to his own desire, spend this and the following night in the haunted apartment; and this for his sake, and my own; for if I should now contradict 
[Page 66]
my former orders, it would subject us both to their impertinent reflections. 
He then took Oswald aside, and charged him not to let Edmund go out of his sight; for if he should come in the way of those implacable enemies, he trembled for the consequences. He then walked back to the stables, and the two friends returned into the house. 
They had a long conversation on various subjects; in the course of it, Edmund acquainted Oswald with all that had passed between him and Joseph the preceding night, the curiosity he had raised in him, and his promise to gratify it the night following. I wish, said Oswald, you would permit me to be one of your party. -How can that be? said Edmund: we shall be watched, perhaps; and, if discovered, what excuse can you make for coming there? Beside, if it were known, I shall be branded with the imputation of cowardice; and, though I have borne much, I will not promise to bear that patiently. -Never fear, replied Oswald, I will speak to Joseph about it; and, after prayers are over and the family gone to bed, I will steal away from my own chamber and come to you. I am strongly interested in your affairs; and I cannot be easy unless you will receive me into your company: I will bind myself to secrecy 
[Page 67]
in any manner you shall enjoin. -Your word is sufficient, said Edmund; I have as much reason to trust you, father, as any man living; I should be ungrateful to refuse you any thing in my power to grant: But suppose the apartment should really be haunted, would you have resolution enough to pursue the adventure to a discovery? -I hope so, said Oswald: But have you any reason to believe it is? -I have, said Edmund; but I have not opened my lips upon this subject to any creature but yourself. This night I purpose, if Heaven permit, to go all over the rooms; and, though I had formed this design, I will confess that your company will strengthen my resolution. I will have no reserves to you in any respect; but I must put a seal upon your lips. Oswald swore secresy till he should be permitted to disclose the mysteries of that apartment; and both of them waited, in solemn expectation, the event of the approaching night. 
In the afternoon Mr. William was allowed to visit his friend: An affecting interview passed between them: He lamented the necessity of Edmund's departure; and they took a solemn leave of each other, as if they foreboded it would be long ere they should meet again. 
About the same hour as the preceding evening, Joseph came to conduct Edmund to his 
[Page 68]
apartment. You will find better accommodations than you had last night, said he, and all by my Lord's own order. -I every hour receive some new proos of his goodness, said Edmund. When they arrived, he found a good fire in the chamber, and a table covered with cold meats, and a flaggon of strong beer. Sit down and get your supper, my dear Master, said Joseph: I must attend my Lord; but as soon as the family are gone to bed, I will visit you again. - Do so, said Edmund; but first, see father Oswald; he has something to say to you: You may trust him, for I have no reserves to him. - Well, Sir, I will see him if you desire it; and I will come to you as soon as possible. So saying, he went his way; and Edmund sat down to supper. 
After a moderate refreshment, he kneeled down, and prayed with the greatest fervency; he resigned himself to the disposal of Heaven: I am nothing, said he, I desire to be nothing but what thou, O Lord, pleasest to make me: If it is thy will that I should return to my former obscurity, be it obeyed with cheerfulness! and, if thou art pleased to exalt me, I will look up to thee, as the only fountain of honour and dignity. While he prayed, he felt an enlargement of heart beyond what he had ever experienced before; all idle fears were dispersed, 
[Page 69]
and his heart glowed with divine love and affiance: He seemed raised above the world and all its pursuits. He continued wrapt up in mental devotion, till a knocking at the door obliged him to rise, and let in his two friends, who came without shoes, and on tiptoe, to visit him. 
Save you, my son! said the friar; you look cheerful and happy. -I am so, father, said Edmund; I have resigned myself to the disposal of Heaven, and I find my heart strengthened above what I can express. -Heaven be praised! said Oswald: I believe you are designed for great things, my son. -What! do you too encourage my ambition? says Edmund; strange concurrence of circumstances! Sit down, my friends; and do you, my good Joseph, tell me the particulars you promised last night. They drew their chairs round the fire, and Joseph began as follows. 
You have heard of the untimely death of the late Lord Lovel, my noble and worthy Master; perhaps you may have also heard that, from that time, this apartment was haunted. What passed the other day, when my Lord questioned you both on this head, brought all the circumstances fresh into my mind. You then said, there were suspicions that he came not fairly to his end. I trust you both, and will speak what I know of it. There was a person 
[Page 70]
suspected of this murder; and whom do you think it was? -You must speak out, said Oswald. -Why then, said Joseph, it was the present Lord Lovel. -You speak my thoughts, said Oswald; but proceed to the proofs. -I will, said Joseph. From the time that my Lord's death was reported, there were strange whisperings and consulations between the new Lord and some of the servants; there was a deal of private business carried on in this apartment: Soon after, they gave out that my poor Lady was distracted; but she threw out strong expressions that savoured nothing of madness: She said, that the ghost of her departed Lord had appeared to her, and revealed the circumstances of this murder. None of the servants, but one, were permitted to see her. At this very time, Sir Walter, the new Lord, had the cruelty to offer love to her; he urged her to marry him; and one of her women overheard her say, she would sooner die than give her hand to the man who caused the death of her Lord: Soon after this, we were told my Lady was dead. The Lord Lovel made a public and sumptuous funeral for her. -That is true, said Oswald; for I was a novice, and assisted at it. 
Well, says Joseph, now comes my part of the story. As I was coming home from the burial, I overtook Roger our ploughman. Said he, 
[Page 71]
What think you of this burying? What should I think, said I, but that we have lost the best Master and Lady that we shall ever know? God he knows, quoth Roger, whether they be living or dead; but if ever I saw my Lady in my life, I saw her alive the night they say she died. I tried to convince him that he was mistaken; but he offered to take his oath, that the very night they said she died, he saw her come out at the garden-gate into the fields; that she often stopped, like a person in pain, and then went forward again until he lost sight of her. Now it is certain that her time was out, and she expected to lie down every day: and they did not pretend that she died in childbed. I thought upon what I heard, but nothing I said. Roger told the same story to another servant; so he was called to an account, the story was hushed up, and the foolish fellow said, he was verily persuaded it was her ghost that he saw. Now you must take notice that, from this time, they began to talk about, that this apartment was troubled: and not only this, but at last the new Lord could not sleep in quiet in his own room; and this induced him to sell the castle to his brother-in-law, and get out of this country as fast as possible. He took most of the servants away with him, and Roger among the rest. As for me, they thought I 
[Page 72]
knew nothing, and so they left me behind; but I was neither blind nor deaf, though I could hear, and see, and say nothing. 
This is a dark story, said Oswald. -It is so, said Edmund; but why should Joseph seem to think it concerns me in particular? -Ah, dear Sir, said Joseph, I must tell you, though I never uttered it to mortal man before; the striking resemblance this young man bears to my dear Lord, the strange dislike his reputed father took to him, his gentle manners, his generous heart, his noble qualities so uncommon in those of his birth and breeding, the sound of his voice-You may smile at the strength of my fancy, but I cannot put it out of my mind but that he is my own Master's son. 
At these words Edmund changed colour and trembled; he clapped his hand upon his breast, and looked up to Heaven in silence; his dream recurred to his memory, and struck upon his heart. He related it to his attentive auditors. The ways of Providence are wonderful, said Oswald. If this be so, Heaven in its own time will make it appear. 
Here a silence of several minutes ensued; when, suddenly, they were awakened from their reverie by a violent noise in the rooms underneath them. It seemed like the clashing of 
[Page 73]
arms, and something seemed to fall down with violence. 
They started, and Edmund rose up with a look full of resolution and intrepidity. -I am called! said he; I obey the call! He took up a lamp, and went to the door that he had opened the night before. Oswald followed with his rosary in his hand, and Joseph last with trembling steps. The door opened with ease, and they descended the stairs in profound silence. 
The lower rooms answered exactly to those above; there were two parlours and a large closet. They saw nothing remarkable in these rooms, except two pictures, that were turned with their faces to the wall. Joseph took the courage to turn them: These, said he, are the portraits of my late Lord and Lady. Father, look at this face; do you know who is like it? -I should think, said Oswald, it was done for Edmund! -I am, said Edmund, struck with the resemblance myself: But let us go on; I feel myself inspired with unusual courage. -Let us open the closet-door. -Oswald stopped him short: Take heed, said he, lest the wind of the door put out the lamp. I will open this door. He attempted it without success; Joseph did the same, but to no purpose: Edmund gave the lamp to Joseph; he approached the door, 
[Page 74]
tried the key, and it gave way to his hand in a moment. This adventure belongs, said he, to me only; that is plain; bring the lamp forward. Oswald repeated the paternoster, in which they all joined, and then entered the closet. 
The first thing that presented itself to their view, was a complete suit of armour, that seemed to have fallen down on an heap. Behold! said Edmund; this made the noise we heard above. They took it up, and examined it piece by piece; the inside of the breast plate was stained with blood. See here! said Edmund; what think you of this? -'Tis my Lord's armour, said Joseph; I know it well: Here has been bloody work in this closet! - Going forward, he stumbled over something; it was a ring with the arms of Lovel engraved upon it. This is my Lord's ring, said Joseph; I have seen him wear it: I give it to you, Sir, as the right owner; and most religiously do I believe you his son. Heaven only knows that, said Edmund; and, if it permits, I will know who was my father before I am a day older. While he was speaking, he shifted his ground, and perceived that the boards rose up on the other side of the closet; upon farther examination they found that the whole floor was loose, and a table that stood over them concealed the circumstance 
[Page 75]
from a casual observer. I perceive, said Oswald, that some great discovery is at hand. -God defend us! said Edmund, but I verily believe that the person that owned this armour lies buried under us. Upon this, a dismal hollow groan was heard, as if from underneath. A solemn silence ensued, and marks of fear were visible upon all three; the groan was thrice heard: Oswald made signs for them to kneel, and he prayed audibly, that Heaven would direct them how to act; he also prayed for the soul of the departed, that it might rest in peace. After this, he arose; but Edmund continued kneeling: He vowed solemnly to devote himself to the discovery of this secret, and the avenging the death of the person there buried. He then rose up. It would be to no purpose, said he, for us to examine further now; when I am properly authorised, I will have this place opened: I trust that time is not far off. - I believe it, said Oswald; you are designed by Heaven to be its instrument in bringing this deed of darkness to light. We are your creatures; only tell us what you would have us do, and we are ready to obey your commands. - I only demand your silence, said Edmund, till I call for your evidence; and then, you must speak all you know, and all you suspect. -Oh, said Joseph, that I may but live to see that 
[Page 76]
day, and I shall have lived long enough! - Come, said Edmund, let us return up stairs, and we will consult further how I shall proceed: So saying, he went out of the closet, and they followed him. He locked the door, and took the key out: I will keep this, said he, till I have power to use it to purpose, lest any one should presume to pry into the secret of this closet: I will always carry it about me, to remind me of what I have undertaken. 
Upon this, they returned up stairs into the bed-chamber; all was still, and they heard nothing more to disturb them. How, said Edmund, is it possible that I should be the son of Lord Lovel? for, however circumstances have seemed to encourage such a notion, what reason have I to believe it? -I am strangely puzzled about it, said Oswald. It seems unlikely that so good a man as Lord Lovel should corrupt the wife of a peasant, his vassal; and, especially, being so lately married to a Lady with whom he was passionately in love. -Hold there! said Joseph; my Lord was incapable of such an action: If Master Edmund is the son of my Lord, he is also the son of my Lady. -How can that be, said Edmund? -I don't know how, said Joseph; but there is a person who can tell if she will: I mean Margery Twyford, who calls herself your mother. -You meet my 
[Page 77]
thoughts, said Edmund; I had resolved, before you spoke, to visit her, and to interrogate her on the subject: I will ask my Lord's permission to go this very day. -That is right, said Oswald; but be cautious and prudent in your enquiries. -If you, said Edmund, would bear me company, I should do better; she might think herself obliged to answer your questions; and, being less interested in the event, you would be more discreet in your interrogations. That I will most readily, said he; and I will ask my Lord's permission for us both-This point is well determined, said Joseph; I am impatient for the result; and I believe my feet will carry me to meet you whether I consent or not. - I am as impatient as you, said Oswald; but let us be silent as the grave, and let not a word or look indicate any thing knowing or mysterious. 
The day-light began to dawn upon their conference; and Edmund, observing it, begged his friends to withdraw in silence. They did so, and left Edmund to his own recollections. His thoughts were too much employed for sleep to approach him; he threw himself upon the bed, and lay meditating how he should proceed; a thousand schemes offered themselves and were rejected: But he resolved, at all 
[Page 78]
events, to leave Baron Fitz-Owen's family the first opportunity that presented itself. 
He was summoned, as before, to attend my Lord at breakfast; during which, he was silent, absent, and reserved. My Lord observed it, and rallied him; enquiring how he had spent the night? -In reflecting upon my situation, my Lord; and in laying plans for my future conduct. Oswald took the hint, and asked permission to visit Edmund's mother in his company, and acquaint her with his intentions of leaving the country soon. He consented freely; but seemed unresolved about Edmund's departure. 
They set out directly, and Edmund went hastily to old Twyford's cottage, declaring that every field seemed a mile to him. Restrain your warmth, my son, said Oswald; compose your mind, and recover your breath, before you enter upon a business of such consequence. Margery met them at the door, and asked Edmund, what wind blew him thither? Is it so very surprising, said he, that I should visit my parents? -Yes, it is, said she, considering the treatment you have met with from us; but since Andrew is not in the house, I may say I am glad to see you: Lord bless you, what a fine youth you be grown! 'Tis a long time since I saw you; 
[Page 79]
but that is not my fault: Many a cross word, and many a blow, have I had on your account; but I may now venture to embrace my dear child. -Edmund came forward and embraced her fervently; the starting tears, on both sides, evinced their affection. And why, said he, should my father forbid you to embrace your child? what have I ever done to deserve his hatred? -Nothing, my dear boy! you were always good and tender-hearted, and deserved the love of every body. -It is not common, said Edmund, for a parent to hate his first-born son without his having deserved it. -That is true, said Oswald; it is uncommon, it is unnatural; nay, I am of opinion it is almost impossible. I am so convinced of this truth, that I believe the man who thus hates and abuses Edmund, cannot be his father. In saying this, he observed her countenance attentively; she canged colour apparently. Come, said he, let us sit down; and do you, Margery, answer to what I have said: Blessed Virgin! said Margery, what does your Reverence mean? what do you suspect? -I suspect, said he, that Edmund is not the son of Andrew your husband. -Lord bless me! said she, what is it you do suspect? -Do not evade my question, woman! I am come here by authority to examine you upon this point. The woman trembled every joint: Would to Heaven! said she, 
[Page 80]
that Andrew was at home! -It is much better as it is, said Oswald: You are the person we are to examine. -Oh, father, said she, do you think that I-that I-that I am to blame in this matter? what have I done? -Do you, Sir, said he, ask your own questions. Upon this, Edmund threw himself at her feet, and embraced her knees. Oh my mother! said he, for as such my heart owns you, tell me for the love of Heaven! tell me, who was my father? -Gracious Heaven! said she, what will become of me? -Woman! said Oswald, confess the truth, or you shall be compelled to do it: By whom had you this youth? -Who, I? said she; I had him! No, father, I am not guilty of the black crime of adultery; God he knows my innocence: I am not worthy to be the mother of such a sweet youth as that is. -You are not his mother, then, nor Andrew his father? -Oh, what shall I do? said Margery; Andrew will be the death of me! -No, he shall not, said Edmund; you shall be protected and rewarded for the discovery. -Goody, said Oswald, confess the whole truth, and I will protect you from harm and from blame; you may be the means of making Edmund's fortune, in which case he will certainly provide for you; on the other hand, by an obstinate silence you will deprive yourself of all advantages you might receive from 
[Page 81]
the discovery; and, beside, you will soon be examined in a different manner, and be obliged to confess all you know, and nobody will thank you for it. -Ah, said she, but Andrew beat me the last time I spoke to Edmund; and told me he would break every bone in my skin, if ever I spoke to him again. -He knows it then? said Oswald-He know it! Lord help you, it was all his own doing. -Tell us then, said Oswald; for Andrew shall never know it, till it is out of his power to punish you. -'Tis a long story, said she, and cannot be told in a few words. - It will never be told at this rate, said he; sit down and begin it instantly. -My fate depends upon your words, said Edmund; my soul is impatient of the suspense! If ever you loved me and cherished me, shew it now, and tell while I have breath to ask it. 
He sat in extreme agitation of mind; his words and actions were equally expressive of his inward emotions. I will, said she; but I must try to recollect all the circumstances. You must know, young man, that you are just one-and-twenty years of age. -On what day was he born, said Oswald? -The day before yesterday, said she, the 21st of September. -A remarkable æra, said he. -'Tis so, indeed, said Edmund: Oh, that night! that apartment! -Be silent, 
[Page 82]
said Oswald; and do you, Margery, begin your story. 
I will, said she. Just one-and-twenty years ago, on that very day, I lost my first-born son: I got a hurt by over-reaching myself, when I was near my time, and so the poor child died. And so, as I was sitting all alone, and very melancholy, Andrew came home from work: See, Margery, said he, I have brought you a child instead of that you have lost. So he gave me a bundle, as I thought; but sure enough it was a child; a poor helpless babe just born, and only rolled up in a fine handkerchief, and over that a rich velvet cloak, trimmed with gold lace. And where did you find this? said I. -Upon the foot-bridge, says he, just below the clay field. This child, said he, belongs to some great folk, and perhaps it may be enquired after one day, and may make our fortunes; take care of it, said he, and bring it up as if it was your own. The poor infant was cold, and it cried, and looked up at me so pitifully, that I loved it; beside, my milk was troublesome to me, and I was glad to be eased of it; so I gave it the breast, and from that hour I loved the child as if it were my own, and so I do still if I dared to own it. -And this is all you know of Edmund's birth? said Oswald. -No, not all, said Margery; but pray look out and see whether Andrew is 
[Page 83]
coming, for I am all over in a twitter. -He is not, said Oswald; go on, I beseech you! - This happened, said she, as I told you, on the 21st. On the morrow, my Andrew went out early to work, along with one Robin Rouse, our neighbour; they had not been gone above an hour, when they both came back seemingly very much frightened: Says Andrew, Go you, Robin, and borrow a pick-axe at neighbour Styles's. What is the matter now? said I- Matter enough! quoth Andrew; we may come to be hanged, perhaps, as many an innocent man has before us. Tell me what is the matter; said I. I will, said he; but if ever you open your mouth about it, woe be to you! I never will, said I: But he made me swear by all the blessed Saints in the Calendar; and then he told me, that, as Robin and he were going over the foot-bridge, where he found the child the evening before, they saw something floating upon the water; so they followed it, till it stuck against a stake, and found it to be the dead body of a woman: As sure as you are alive, Madge, said he, this was the mother of the child I brought home. -Merciful God! said Edmund; am I the child of that hapless mother? -Be composed, said Oswald: Proceed, good woman, the time is precious. -And so, continued she, Andrew told me they dragged the body out of the river, 
[Page 84]
and it was richly dressed, and must be somebody of consequence. I suppose, said he, when the poor Lady had taken care of her child, she went to find some help; and, the night being dark, her foot slipped, and she fell into the river, and was drowned. 
Lord have mercy! said Robin, what shall we do with the dead body? we may be taken up for the murder; what had we to do to meddle with it? Aye, but, says Andrew, we must have something to do with it now; and our wisest way is to bury it. Robin was sadly frightened, but at last they agreed to carry it into the wood, and bury it there; so they came home for a pick-axe and shovel. Well, said I, Andrew, but will you bury all the rich clothes you speak of? Why, said he, it would be both a sin and a shame to strip the dead. So it would, said I; but I will give you a sheet to wrap the body in, and you may take off her upper garments, and any thing of value; but do not strip her to the skin for any thing. Well said, wench! said he; I will do as you say. So I fetched a sheet, and by that time Robin was come back, and away they went together. 
They did not come back again till noon, and then they sat down and ate a morsel together. Says Andrew, Now we may sit down and eat in 
[Page 85]
peace. Aye, says Robin, and sleep in peace too, for we have done no harm. No, to be sure, said I; but yet I am much concerned that the poor Lady had not Christian burial. Never trouble thyself about that, said Andrew; we have done the best we could for her: But let us see what we have got in our bags; we must divide them. So they opened their bags, and took out a fine gown and a pair of rich shoes; but, besides these, there was a fine necklace with a golden locket, and a pair of ear-rings. Says Andrew, and winked at me, I will have these, and you may take the rest. Robin said, he was satisfied, and so he went his way. When he was gone, Here, you fool, says Andrew, take these, and keep them as safe as the bud of your eye: If ever young Master is found, these will make our fortune. -And have you them now? said Oswald. -Yes, that I have, answered she; Andrew would have sold them long ago, but I always put him off it. -Heaven be praised! said Edmund. -Hush, said Oswald, let us not lose time; proceed, Goody! -Nay, said Margery, I have not much more to say. We looked every day to hear some enquiries after the child, but nothing passed, nobody was missing. -Did nobody of note die about that time? said Oswald. -Why yes, said Margery, the widow Lady Lovel died that same week: By the same token, 
[Page 86]
Andrew went to the funeral, and brought home a 'scutcheon, which I keep unto this day. -Very well; go on. -My husband behaved well enough to the boy, till such time as he had two or three children of his own; and then he began to grumble, and say, it was hard to maintain other folks' children, when he found it hard enough to keep his own: I loved the boy quite as well as my own; often and often have I pacified Andrew, and made him to hope that he should one day or other be paid for his trouble; but at last he grew out of patience, and gave over all hopes of that kind. 
As Edmund grew up, he grew sickly and tender, and could not bear hard labour; and that was another reason why my husband could not bear with him. If, quoth he, the boy could earn his living, I did not care; but I must bear all the expence. There came an old pilgrim into our parts; he was a scholar, and had been a soldier, and he taught Edmund to read; then he told him histories of wars, and Knights, and Lords, and great men; and Edmund took such delight in hearing him, that he would not take to any thing else. 
To be sure, Edwin was a pleasant companion; he would tell old stories, and sing old songs, that one could have sat all night to hear him; but, as I was a saying, Edmund grew more 
[Page 87]
and more fond of reading, and less of work; however, he would run of errands, and do many handy turns for the neighbours; and he was so courteous a lad, that people took notice of him. Andrew once catched him alone reading, and then told him, that if he did not find some way to earn his bread, he would turn him out of doors in a very short time; and so he would have done, sure enough, if my Lord Fitz-Owen had not taken him into his service just in the nick. 
Very well, Goody, said Oswald; you have told your story very well; I am glad, for Edmund's sake, that you can do it so properly: But now, can you keep a secret? -Why, an't please your Reverence, I think I have shewed you that I can. -But can you keep it from your husband? Aye, said she, surely I can; for I dare not tell it him. -That is a good security, said he; but I must have a better: You must swear upon this book not to disclose any thing that has passed between us three, till we desire you to do it. Be assured you will soon be called upon for this purpose; Edmund's birth is near the discovery: He is the son of parents of high degree; and it will be in his power to make your fortune, when he takes possession of his own. 
Holy Virgin! what is it you tell me? How you rejoice me to hear, that what I have so long prayed for will come to pass! -She took the 
[Page 88]
oath required, saying after Oswald. -Now, said he, go and fetch the tokens you have mentioned. 
When she was gone, Edmund's passions, long suppressed, broke out in tears and exclamations; he kneeled down, and, with his hands clasped together, returned thanks to Heaven for the discovery. Oswald begged him to be composed, lest Margery should perceive his agitation, and misconstrue the cause. She soon returned with the necklace and ear-rings: They were pearls of great value; and the necklace had a locket, on which the cypher of Lovel was engraved. This, said Oswald, is indeed a proof of consequence: Keep it, Sir, for it belongs to you. - Must he take it away? said she. -Certainly, returned Oswald; we can do nothing without it: But if Andrew should ask for it, you must put him off for the present, and hereafter he will find his account in it. Margery consented reluctantly to part with the jewels; and, after some further conversation, they took leave of her. Edmund embraced her affectionately. I thank you with my whole heart, said he, for all your goodness to me! Though I confess, I never felt much regard for your husband, yet for you I had always the tender affection of a son. You will, I trust, give your evidence in my behalf when called upon; and I hope it will one day be in my power to reward your kindness: 
[Page 89]
In that case, I will own you as my foster-mother, and you shall always be treated as such. -Margery wept. The Lord grant it! said she; and I pray him to have you in his holy keeping. Farewel, my dear child! -Oswald desired them to separate for fear of intrusion; and they returned to the Castle. Margery stood at the door of her cottage, looking every way to see if the coast was clear. 
Now, Sir, said Oswald, I congratulate you as the son of Lord and Lady Lovel; the proofs are strong and indisputable. To us they are so, said Edmund; but how shall we make them so to others? and what are we to think of the funeral of Lady Lovel? -As of a fiction, said Oswald; the work of the present Lord, to secure his title and fortune. -And what means can we use to dispossess him? said Edmund: He is not a man for a poor youth like me to contend with. -Doubt not, said Oswald, but Heaven, who has evidently conducted you by the hand thus far, will complete its own work; for my part, I can only wonder and adore! - Give me your advice then, said Edmund; for Heaven assists us by natural means. 
It seems to me, said Oswald, that your first step must be to make a friend of some great man, of consequence enough to espouse your cause, and to get this affair examined into by 
[Page 90]
authority. Edmund started, and crossed himself; he suddenly exclaimed-A friend! Yes; I have a friend! a powerful one too; one sent by Heaven to be my protector, but whom I have too long neglected,-Who can that be? said Oswald. -Who should it be, said Edmund, but that good Sir Philip Harclay, the chosen friend of him, whom I shall from henceforward call my father. -'Tis true indeed, said Oswald; and this is a fresh proof of what I before observed, that Heaven assists you, and will complete its own work. -I think so myself, said Edmund, and rely upon its direction. I have already determined on my future conduct, which I will communicate to you. My first step shall be to leave the Castle; my Lord has this day given me a horse, upon which I purpose to set out this very night, without the knowledge of any of the family. I will go to Sir Philip Harclay; I will throw myself at his feet, relate my strange story, and implore his protection: With him I will consult on the most proper way of bringing this murderer to public justice; and I will be guided by his advice and direction in every thing. -Nothing can be better, said Oswald, than what you propose; but give me leave to offer an addition to your scheme. You shall set off in the dead of night, as you intend; Joseph, and I, will favour 
[Page 91]
your departure in such a manner as to throw a mystery over the circumstances of it: Your disappearing at such a time from the haunted apartment, will terrify and confound all the family; they will puzzle themselves in vain to account for it, and they will be afraid to pry into the secrets of that place. 
You say well, and I approve your addition, replied Edmund. Suppose, likewise, there was a letter written in a mysterious manner, and dropt in my Lord's way, or sent to him afterwards; it would forward our design, and frighten them away from that apartment. -That shall be my care, said Oswald; and I will warrant you that they will not find themselves disposed to inhabit it presently. -But how shall I leave my dear friend Mr. William, without a word of notice of this separation? -I have thought of that too, said Oswald; and I will so manage, as to acquaint him with it in such a manner as he shall think out of the common course of things, and which shall make him wonder and be silent. -How will you do that, said Edmund? -I will tell you hereafter, said Oswald; for here comes old Joseph to meet us. 
He came, indeed, as fast as his age would permit him. As soon as he was within hearing, he asked them what news? They related all that had passed at Twyford's cottage; he heard 
[Page 92]
them with the greatest eagerness of attention, and as soon as they came to the great event- I knew it! I knew it! exclaimed Joseph; I was sure it would prove so! Thank God for it! But I will be the first to acknowledge my young Lord, and I will live and die his faithful servant! Here Joseph attempted to kneel to him, but Edmund prevented him with a warm embrace: My friend! my dear friend! said he, I cannot suffer a man of your age to kneel to me; are you not one of my best and truest friends? I will ever remember your disinterested affection for me; and if heaven restores me to my rights, it shall be one of my first cares to render your old age easy and happy. Joseph wept over him, and it was some time before he could utter a word. 
Oswald gave them both time to recover their emotion, by acquainting Joseph with Edmund's scheme for his departure. Joseph wiped his eyes and spoke. I have thought, said he, of something that will be both agreeable and useful to my dear Master. John Wyatt, Sir Philip Harclay's servant, is now upon a visit at his father's; I have heard that he goes home soon; now he would be both a guide and companion, on the way. -That is, indeed, a happy circumstance, said Edmund; but how shall we know certainly the time of his departure? 
[Page 93]
-Why, Sir, I will go to him, and enquire; and bring you word directly. -Do so, said Edmund, and you will oblige me greatly. - But, Sir, said Oswald, I think it will be best not to let John Wyatt know who is to be his companion; only let Joseph tell him that a gentleman is going to visit his Master: And, if possible, prevail upon him to set out this night. -Do so, my good friend, said Edmund; and tell him, further, that this person has business of great consequence to communicate to his Master, and cannot delay his journey on any account. -I will do this, you may depend, said Joseph, and acquaint you with my success as soon as possible; but, Sir, you must not go without a guide, at any rate. -I trust I shall not, said Edmund, though I go alone; he that has received such a call as I have, can want no other, nor fear any danger. 
They conversed on these points till they drew near the castle, when Joseph left them to go on his errand, and Edmund attended his Lord at dinner. The Baron observed that he was silent and reserved; the conversation languished on both sides. As soon as dinner was ended, Edmund asked permission to go up into his own apartment; where he packed up some necessaries, and made a hasty preparation for his departure. 

[Page 94]
Afterwards he walked into the garden, revolving in his mind the peculiarity of his situation, and the uncertainty of his future prospects; lost in thought, he walked to and fro in a covered walk, with his arms crossed and his eyes cast down, without perceiving that he was observed by two females who stood at a distance watching his motions: It was the Lady Emma, and her attendant, who were thus engaged. At length, he lifted up his eyes and saw them: he stood still, and was irresolute whether to advance or retire: They approached him; and, as they drew near, fair Emma spoke. You have been so wrapt in meditation, Edmund, that I am apprehensive of some new vexation that I am yet a stranger to: Would it were in my power to lessen those you have already! But tell me if I guess truly? -He stood still irresolute, he answered with hesitation. Oh, Lady- I am-I am grieved, I am concerned, to be the cause of so much confusion in this noble family, to which I am so much indebted: I see no way to lessen these evils but to remove the cause of them. -Meaning yourself? said she. - Certainly, Madam; and I was meditating on my departure. -But, said she, by your departure you will not remove the cause. -How so, Madam? -Because you are not the cause, but those you will leave behind you. -Lady 
[Page 95]
Emma! -How can you affect this ignorance, Edmund? You know well enough it is that odious Wenlock, your enemy and my aversion, that has caused all this mischief among us, and will much more, if he is not removed. - This, Madam, is a subject that it becomes me to be silent upon: Mr. Wenlock is your kinsman; he is not my friend; and for that reason I ought not to speak against him, nor you to hear it from me: If he has used me ill, I am recompensed by the generous treatment of my Lord your father, who is all that is great and good; he has allowed me to justify myself to him, and he has restored me to his good opinion, which I prize among the best gifts of heaven: Your amiable brother Williarn thinks well of me, and his esteem is infinitely dear to me; and you, excellent Lady, perinit me to hope that you honour me with your good opinion: Are not these ample amends for the ill-will Mr. Wenlock bears me? -My opinion of you, Edmund, said she, is fixed and settled: It is not founded upon events of yesterday, but upon long knowledge and experience; upon your whole conduct and character. -You honour me, Lady! Continue to think well of me, it will excite me to deserve it. When I am far distant from this place, the remembrance of your goodness will be a cordial to my heart. -But 
[Page 96]
why will you leave us, Edmund? Stay and defeat the designs of your enemy; you shall have my wishes and assistance. -Pardon me, Madam, that is among the things I cannot do, even if it were in my power, which it is not. Mr. Wenlock loves you, Lady, and if he is so unhappy as to be your aversion, that is a punishment severe enough. For the rest, I may be unfortunate by the wickedness of others, but if I am unworthy, it must be by my own fault. -So then you think it is an unworthy action to oppose Mr. Wenlock! Very well, Sir: Then I suppose you wish him success; you wish that I may be married to him? -I, Madam! said Edmund, confused; what am I that I should give my opinion on an affair of so much consequence? You distress me by the question. May you be happy! may you enjoy your own wishes! He sighed, he turned away. She called him back; he trembled, and kept silence. 
She seemed to enjoy his confusion; she was cruel enough to repeat the question. Tell me, Edmund, and truly, do you wish to see me give my hand to Wenlock? I insist upon your answer. -All on a sudden he recovered both his voice and courage; he stepped forward, his person erect, his countenance assured, his voice resolute and intrepid. Since Lady Emma 
[Page 97]
insists upon my answer, since she avows a dislike to Wenlock, since she condescends to ask my opinion, I will tell her my thoughts, my wishes. The fair Emma now trembled in her turn; she blushed, looked down, and was ashamed to have spoken so freely. Edmund went on: My most ardent wishes are, that the fair Emma may reserve her heart and hand till a certain person, a friend of mine, is at liberty to solicit them; whose utmost ambition is, first to deserve, and then to obtain them. -Your friend, Sir! said Lady Emma! her brow clouded, her eye disdainful. Edmund proceeded: My friend is so particularly circumstanced that he cannot at present with propriety ask for Lady Emma's favour; but as soon as he has gained a cause that is yet in suspence, he will openly declare his pretensions, and if he is unsuccessful, he will then condemn himself to eternal silence. Lady Emma knew not what to think of this declaration; she hoped, she feared, she meditated; but her attention was too strongly excited to be satisfied without some gratification: After a pause, she pursued the subject. And this friend of yours, Sir, of what degree and fortune is he? Edmund smiled; but, commanding his emotion, he replied, his birth is noble, his degree and fortune uncertain. Her countenance fell, she 
[Page 98]
sighed; he proceeded. It is utterly impossible, said he, for any man of inferior degree to aspire to Lady Emma's favour; her noble birth, the dignity of her beauty and virtues, must awe and keep at their proper distance, all men of inferior degree and merit; they may admire, they may revere; but they must not presume to approach too near, lest their presumption should meet with its punishment. -Well, Sir, said she, suddenly; and so this friend of yours has commiffioned you to speak in his behalf? -He has, Madam. -Then I must tell you, that I think his assurance is very great, and yours not much less. -I am sorry for that, Madam. -Tell him, that I shall reserve my heart and hand for the man to whom my father shall bid me give them. -Very well, Lady; I am certain my Lord loves you too well to dispose of them against your inclination. -How do you know that, Sir? But tell him, that the man that hopes for my favour must apply to my Lord for his. That is my friend's intention, his resolution I should say, as soon as he can do it with propriety; and I accept your permission for him to do so. -My permission did you say? I am astonished at your assurance! tell me no more of your friend: But perhaps you are pleading for Wenlock all this time: It is all one to me; only, say no more. -Are you offended with me, 
[Page 99]
Madam? -No matter, Sir. -Yes, it is. -I am surprised at you, Edmund;-I am surprised at my own temerity; but, forgive me. -It does not signify; good bye ty'e, Sir. -Don't leave me in anger, Madam; I cannot bear that: Perhaps I may not see you again for a long time. He looked afflicted; she turned back. I do forgive you, Edmund: I was concerned for you; but, it seems, you are more concerned for every body than for yourself. She sighed: Farewel! said she. -Edmund gazed on her with tenderness; he approached her, he just touched her hand; his heart was rising to his lips, but he recollected his situation; he checked himself immediately; he retired back, he sighed deeply, bowed low, and hastily quitted her. 
The Lady turning into another walk, he reached the house first, and went up again to his chamber; he threw himself upon his knees; prayed for a thousand blessings upon every one of the family of his benefactor, and involuntarily wept at mentioning the name of the charming Emma, whom he was about to leave abruptly, and perhaps for ever. He then endeavoured to compose himself, and once more attended the Baron; wished him a good night; and withdrew to his chamber, till he was called upon to go again to the haunted apartment. 

[Page 100]
He came down equipped for his journey, and went hastily for fear of observation; he paid his customary devotions, and soon after Oswald tapped at the door. They conferred together upon the interesting subject that engrossed their attention, until Joseph came to them; who brought the rest of Edmund's baggage, and some refreshment for him before he set out. Edmund promised to give them the earliest information of his situation and success. At the hour of twelve they heard the same groans as the night before in the lower apartment; but, being somewhat familiarized to it, they were not so strongly affected: Oswald crossed himself, and prayed for the departed soul; he also prayed for Edmund, and recommended him to the divine protection: He then arose, and embraced that young man; who, also, took a tender leave of his friend Joseph. They then went, with silence and caution, through a long gallery; they descended the stairs in the same manner; they crossed the hall in profound silence, and hardly dared to breathe, lest they should be overheard: They found some difficulty in opening one of the solding doors, which at last they accomplished; they were again in jeopardy at the outward gate; at length they conveyed him safely into the stables: 
[Page 101]
There they again embraced him, and prayed for his prosperity. 
He then mounted his horse, and set forward to Wyatt's cottage; he hallooed at the door, and was answered from within: In a few minutes John came out to him. -What, is it you, Master Edmund? -Hush! said he; not a word of who I am: I go upon private business, and would not wish to be known. -If you will go forward, Sir, I will soon overtake you: He did so; and they pursued their journey to the north. In the mean time, Oswald and Joseph returned in silence into the house; they retired to their respective apartments without hearing or being heard by any one. 
About the dawn of day Oswald intended to lay his pacquets in the way of those to whom they were addressed; after much contrivance he determined to take a bold step, and, if he were discovered, to frame some excuse. Encouraged by his late success, he went on tip-toe into Master William's chamber, placed a letter upon his pillow, and withdrew unheard. Exulting in his heart, he attempted the Baron's apartment, but found it fastened within; finding this scheme frustrated, he waited till the hour the Baron was expected down to breakfast, and laid the letter and the key of the haunted apartment upon the table. 

[Page 102]
Soon after, he saw the Baron enter the Breakfast room; he got out of sight, but staid within call, preparing himself for a summons. The Baron sat down to breakfast; he saw a letter directed to himself, he opened it, and to his great surprise, read as follows: 

"" 
The Baron was struck with amazement at the letter: He took up the key, examined it, then laid it down, and took up the letter; he was in such confusion of thought, he knew not what to do or say for several minutes: At length he called his servants about him; the first question he asked was,-Where is Edmund? -They could not tell. -Has he been called? - Yes, my Lord, but nobody answered, and the key was not in the door. -Where is Joseph? -Gone into the stables. -Where is father Oswald? -In his study. -Seek him, and desire him to come hither. -By the time the Baron had read the letter over again, he came. 

[Page 103]
He had been framing a steady countenance to answer to all interrogatories; as he came in he attentively observed the Baron, whose features were in strong agitation; as soon as he saw Oswald, he spoke as one out of breath. -Take that key, and read this letter! -He did so, shrugged up his shoulders, and remained silent. -Father, said my Lord, what think you of this letter? -It is a very surprising one. -The contents are alarming; where is Edmund? - I do not know. -Has nobody seen him? -Not that I know of. -Call my sons, my kinsmen, my servants. -The servants came in. -Have any of you seen or heard of Edmund? -No, was the answer. -Father, step up stairs to my sons and kinsmen, and desire them to come down immediately. 
Oswald withdrew; and went, first, to Mr. William's chamber. My dear Sir, you must come to my Lord now directly; he has something extraordinary to communicate to you. - And so have I, father; see what I have found upon my pillow! Pray, Sir, read it to me before you shew it to any body; my Lord is alarmed too much already, and wants nothing to increase his consternation. William read his letter, while Oswald looked as if he was an utter stranger to the contents, which were these: 

[Page 104]

"" 
What, said William can this mean? -It is not easy to say, replied Oswald. -Can you tell what is the cause of this alarm? -I can tell you nothing, but that my Lord desires to see you directly; pray make haste down; I must go up to your brothers and kinsmen: Nobody knows what to think, or believe. 
Master William went down stairs, and father Oswald went to the malecontents: As soon as he entered the outward door of their apartment, Mr. Wenlock called out. -Here comes the friend; now for some new proposal! - Gentlemen, said Oswald, my Lord desires your company immediately in the breakfast parlour. -What! to meet your favourite Edmund, I suppose? said Mr. Wenlock. -No, Sir. - What, then, is the matter? said Sir Robert. - Something very extraordinary has happened, gentlemen: Edmund is not to be found; he disappeared from the haunted apartment, the key of which was conveyed to my Lord in a strange 
[Page 105]
manner, with a letter from an unknown hand: My Lord is both surprised and concerned, and wishes to have your opinion and advice on the occasion. -Tell him, said Sir Robert, we will wait upon him immediately. 
As Oswald went away, he heard Wenlock say,-So Edmund is gone, it is no matter how, or whither. -Another said, I hope the ghost has taken him out of the way. The rest laughed at the conceit, as they followed Oswald down stairs. -They found the Baron, and his son William, commenting upon the key and the letter. My Lord gave them to Sir Robert, who looked on them with marks of surprise and confusion. The Baron addressed him: Is not this a very strange affair? Son Robert, lay aside your ill humours, and behave to your father with the respect and affection his tenderness deserves from you, and give me your advice and opinion on this alarming subject. -My Lord, said Sir Robert, I am as much confounded as yourself: I can give no advice: Let my cousins see the letter; let us have their opinion. They read it in turn; they were equally surprised: But when it came into Wenlock's hand, he paused and meditated some minutes; at length-I am indeed surprised, and still more concerned, to see my Lord and Uncle the dupe of an artful contrivance; and, if he will permit me, I shall endeavour to unriddle 
[Page 106]
it, to the confusion of all that are concerned in it. -Do so, Dick, said my Lord, and you shall have my thanks for it. -This letter, said he, I imagine to be the contrivance of Edmund, or some ingenious friend of his, to conceal some designs they have against the peace of this family, which has been too often disturbed upon that rascal's account. -But what end could be proposed by it? said the Baron. -Why, one part of the scheme is to cover Edmund's departure, that is clear enough; for the rest, we can only guess at it: Perhaps he may be concealed somewhere in that apartment, from whence he may rush out in the night, and either rob or murder us; or, at least, alarm and terrify the family. -The Baron smiled: You shoot beyond the mark, Sir, and overshoot yourself, as you have done before now; you shew only your inveteracy against that poor lad, whom you cannot mention with temper: To what purpose should he shut himself up there, to be starved? -Starved! no, no! he has friends in this house (looking at Oswald), who will not suffer him to want any thing: Those who have always magnified his virtues, and extenuated his faults, will lend a hand to help him in time of need; and, perhaps, to assist his ingenious contrivances. -Oswald shrugged up his shoulders, and remained silent. This is a strange fancy of 
[Page 107]
yours, Dick, said my Lord; but I am willing to pursue it; first, to discover what you drive at; and, secondly, to satisfy all that are here present of the truth or falsehood of it, that they may know what value to set upon your sagacity hereafter. Let us all go over that apartment together; and let Joseph be called to attend us thither. Oswald offered to call him, but Wenlock stopped him. No, father, said he, you must stay with us; we want your ghostly counsel and advice: Joseph shall have no private conference with you. -What mean you, said Oswald, to insinuate to my Lord against me, or Joseph? But your ill-will spares nobody. It will one day be known who is the disturber of the peace of this family; I wait for that time, and am silent. 
Joseph came; when he was told whither they were going, he looked hard at Oswald. Wenlock observed them: Lead the way, father, said he; and Joseph shall follow us. Oswald smiled: We will go where Heaven permits us, said he; alas! the wisdom of man can neither hasten, nor retard, its decrees. 
They followed the father up stairs, and went directly to the haunted apartment. The Baron unlocked the door; he bid Joseph open the shutters, and admit the day-light, which had been excluded for many years. They went 
[Page 108]
over the rooms above stairs, and then descended the staircase, and through the lower rooms in the same manner. However, they overlooked the closet, in which the fatal secret was concealed; the door was covered with tapestry, the same as the room, and united so well that it seemed but one piece. Wenlock tauntingly desired father Oswald to introduce them to the ghost. The father, in reply, asked them where they should find Edmund: Do you think, said he, that he lies hid in my pocket, or in Joseph's? -'Tis no matter, answered he; thoughts are free. -My opinion of you, Sir, said Oswald, is not founded upon thoughts: I judge of men by their actions; a rule, I believe, it will not suit you to be tried by. -None of your insolent admonitions, father! returned Wenlock; this is neither the time nor the place for them. -That is truer than you are aware of, Sir; I meant not to enter into the subject just now. -Be silent, said my Lord. -I shall enter into this subject with you hereafter; then look you be prepared for it! In the mean time, do you, Dick Wenlock, answer to my questions. Do you think Edmund is concealed in this apartment? -No, Sir. -Do you think there is any mystery in it? -No, my Lord. -Is it haunted, think you? - No, I think not. -Should you be afraid to try? -In what manner, my Lord? -Why, you have 
[Page 109]
shewn your wit upon the subject, and I mean to shew your courage; you, and Jack Markham your confident, shall sleep here three nights, as Edmund has done before. -Sir, said Sir Robert, for what purpose? I should be glad to understand why. -I have my reasons, Sir, as well as your kinsmen there. No reply, Sirs! I insist upon being obeyed in this point. Joseph, let the beds be well aired, and every thing made agreeable to the Gentlemen: If there is any contrivance to impose upon me, they, I am sure, will have pleasure in detecting it; and, if not, I shall obtain my end in making these rooms habitable. Oswald, come with me; and the rest may go where they list till dinner-time. 
The Baron went with Oswald into the parlour. Now tell me, father, said he, do you disapprove what I have done? -Quite the contrary, my Lord, said he; I entirely approve it. - But you do not know all my reasons for it. Yesterday Edmund's behaviour was different from what I have ever seen it; he is naturally frank and open in all his ways; but he was then silent, thoughtful, absent; he sighed deeply, and once I saw tears stand in his eyes: Now, I do suspect there is something uncommon in that apartment; that Edmund has discovered the secret; and, fearing to disclose it, he is fled away from the house. As to this letter, perhaps 
[Page 110]
he may have written it to hint that there is more than he dares reveal; I tremble at the hints contained in it, though I shall appear to make light of it: But I and mine are innocent; and if Heaven discloses the guilt of others, I ought to adore and submit to its decrees. -That is prudently and piously resolved, my Lord; let us do our duty, and leave events to Heaven. -But, father, I have a further view in obliging my kinsmen to sleep there: If any thing should appear to them, it is better that it should only be known to my own family; if there is nothing in it, I shall put to the proof the courage and veracity of my two kinsmen, of whom I think very indifferently. I mean shortly to enquire into many things I have heard lately to their disadvantage; and, if I find them guilty, they shall not escape with impunity. -My Lord, said Oswald, you judge like yourself; I wish you to make enquiry concerning them, and believe the result will be to their confusion, and your Lordship will be enabled to re-establish the peace of your family. 
During this conversation, Oswald was upon his guard, lest any thing should escape that might create suspicion. He withdrew as soon as he could with decency, and left the Baron meditating what all these things should mean: He feared there was some misfortune impending 
[Page 111]
over his house, though he knew not from what cause. 
He dined with his children and kinsmen, and strove to appear cheerful; but a gloom was perceivable through his deportment. Sir Robert was reserved and respectful; Mr. William was silent and attentive; the rest of the family dutifully assiduous to my Lord; only Wenlock and Markham were sullen and chagrined. The Baron detained the young men the whole afternoon; he strove to amuse and to be amused; he shewed the greatest affection and parental regard to his children, and endeavoured to conciliate their affections, and engage their gratitude by kindness. Wenlock and Markham felt their courage abate as the night approached: At the hour of nine, old Joseph came to conduct them to the haunted apartment; they took leave of their kinsmen, and went up stairs with heavy hearts. 
They found the chamber set in order for them, and a table spread with provision and good liquor to keep up their spirits. It seems, said Wenlock, that your friend Edmund was obliged to you for his accommodations here. -Sir, said Joseph, his accommodations were bad enough the first night; but, afterwards, they were bettered by my Lord's orders. -Owing to your officious cares? said Wenlock: I own it, said 
[Page 112]
Joseph, and I am not ashamed of it. -Are you not anxious to know what is become of him? said Markham. -Not at all, Sir; I trust he is in the best protection; so good a young man as he is, is safe every where. -You see, cousin Jack, said Wenlock, how this villain has stole the hearts of my uncle's servants: I suppose this canting old fellow knows where he is, if the truth were known. -Have you any further commands for me, Gentlemen? said the old man. -No, not we. -Then I am ordered to attend my Lord, when you have done with me. - Go, then, about your business. Joseph went away, glad to be dismissed. 
What shall we do, cousin Jack, said Wenlock, to pass away the time? it is plaguy dull sitting here. -Dull enough, said Markham; I think the best thing we can do, is to go to bed and sleep it away. -Faith, says Wenlock, I am in no disposition to sleep! Who would have thought the old man would have obliged us to spend the night here? -Don't say us, I beg of you; it was all your own doing, replied Markham. -I did not intend he should have taken me at my word. -Then you should have spoken more cautiously. I have always been governed by you, like a fool as I am; you play the braggart, and I suffer for it: But they begin to see through your fine-spun arts and contrivances, 
[Page 113]
and I believe you will meet with your deserts one day or other. -What now? do you mean to affront me, Jack? Know, that some are born to plan, others to execute; I am one of the former, thou of the latter: Know your friend, or -Or what? replied Markham; do you mean to threaten me? If you do! -What then? said Wenlock. -Why, then, I will try which of us two is the best man, Sir! Upon this Markham arose, and put himself into a posture of defence. Wenlock perceiving he was serious in his anger, began to sooth him; he persuaded, he flattered, he promised great things if he would be composed. Markham was sullen, uneasy, resentful; whenever he spoke, it was to upbraid Wenlock with his treachery and falsehood. Wenlock tried all his eloquence to get him into a good humour, but in vain; he threatened to acquaint his Uncle with all that he knew, and to exculpate himself at the other's expence. Wenlock began to find his choler rise; they were both almost choaked with rage; and, at length, they both rose with a resolution to fight. 
As they stood with their fists clenched, on a sudden they were alarmed with a dismal groan from the room underneath. They stood like statues petrified by fear, yet listening with trembling expectation: A second groan increased their consternation; and, soon after, a third 
[Page 114]
completed it. They staggered to a seat, and sunk down upon it, ready to faint; presently, all the doors flew open, a pale glimmering light appeared at the door, from the staircase, and a man in complete armour entered the room: He stood, with one hand extended, pointing to the outward door; they took the hint, and crawled away as fast as fear would let them; they staggered along the gallery, and from thence to the Baron's apartment, where Wenlock sunk down in a swoon, and Markham had just strength enough to knock at the door. 
The servant who slept in the outward room alarmed his Lord: Markham cried out-For Heaven's sake, let us in! Upon hearing his voice, the door was opened, and Markham approached his Uncle in such an attitude of fear, as excited a degree of it in the Baron. He pointed to Wenlock, who was with some difficulty recovered from the fit he was fallen into; the servant was terrified, he rung the alarm-bell; the servants came running from all parts to their Lord's apartment: The young Gentlemen came likewise, and presently all was confusion, and the terror was universal. Oswald, who guessed the business, was the only one that could question them; he asked, several times,-What is the matter? -Markham, at last, answered him: We have seen the ghost! -All regard to secrecy 
[Page 115]
was now at an end; the echo ran through the whole family:-They have seen the ghost! 
The Baron desired Oswald to talk to the young men, and endeavour to quiet the disturbance. He came forward; he comforted some, he rebuked others; he bad the servants retire into the outward room: The Baron, with his sons and kinsmen, remained in the bed-chamber. It is very unfortunate, said Oswald, that this affair should be made so public; surely these young men might have related what they had seen, without alarming the whole family: I am very much concerned upon my Lord's account. -I thank you, father, said the Baron; but prudence was quite overthrown here: Wenlock was half dead, and Markham half distracted; the family were alarmed without my being able to prevent it: But let us hear what these poor terrified creatures say. Oswald demanded, What have you seen, Gentlemen? -The ghost! said Markham. -In what form did it appear? -A man in armour. -Did it speak to you? - No. -What did it do to terrify you so much? - It stood at the farthest door, and pointed to the outward door, as if to have us leave the room; we did not wait for a second notice, but came away as fast as we could. -Did it follow you? -No. -Then you need not have raised such a disturbance. Wenlock lifted up his head, 
[Page 116]
and spoke: I believe, father, if you had been with us, you would not have stood upon ceremonies any more than we did. I wish my Lord would send you to parley with the ghost; for, without doubt, you are better qualified than we. -My Lord, said Oswald, I will go thither, with your permission; I will see that every thing is safe, and bring the key back to you: Perhaps this may help to dispel the fears that have been raised; at least, I will try to do it. -I thank you, father, for your good offices; do as you please. 
Oswald went into the outward room. I am going, said he, to shut up the apartment: The young Gentlemen have been more frightened than they had occasion for; I will try to account for it. Which of you will go with me? They all drew back, except Joseph, who offered to bear him company. They went into the bedroom in the haunted apartment, and found every thing quiet there. They put out the fire, extinguished the lights, locked the door, and brought away the key. As they returned, I thought how it would be, said Joseph. -Hush! not a word, said Oswald; you find we are suspected of something, though they know not what. Wait till you are called upon, and then we will both speak to purpose. They carried the key to the Baron. 

[Page 117]
All is quiet in the apartment, said Oswald, as we can testisy. -Did you ask Joseph to go with you, said the Baron, or did he offer himself? -My Lord, I asked if any body would go with me, and they all declined it but he; I thought proper to have a witness beside myself, for whatever might be seen or heard. -Joseph, you was servant to the late Lord Lovel; what kind of man was he? -A very comely man, please your Lordship. -Should you know him if you were to see him? -I cannot say, my Lord. -Would you have any objection to sleep a night in that apartment? -I beg,-I hope,-I beseech your Lordship not to command me to do it! - You are then afraid; why did you offer yourself to go thither? -Because I was not so much frightened as the rest. -I wish you would lie a night there; but, I do not insist upon it. -My Lord, I am a poor ignorant old man, not fit for such an undertaking: Beside, if I should see the ghost, and if it should be the person of my Master, and if it should tell me any thing, and bid me keep it secret, I should not dare to disclose it; and then, what service should I do your Lordship? -That is true, indeed, said the Baron. 
This speech, said Sir Robert, is both a simple and an artful one: You see, however, that Joseph is not a man for us to depend upon; he 
[Page 118]
regards the Lord Lovel, though dead, more than Lord Fitz-Owen, living; he calls him his Master, and promises to keep his secrets. What say you, father, Is the ghost your Master, or your friend? Are you under any obligation to keep his secrets? -Sir, said Oswald, I answer as Joseph does; I would sooner die than discover a secret revealed in that manner. -I thought as much, said Sir Robert; there is a mystery in father Oswald's behaviour, that I cannot comprehend. -Do not reflect upon the father, said the Baron, I have no cause to complain of him; perhaps the mystery may be too soon explained: But let us not anticipate evils. Oswald and Joseph have spoken like good men; I am satisfied with their answers: Let us, who are innocent, rest in peace; and let us endeavour to restore peace in the family; and do you, father, assist us:-With my best services, said Oswald. He called the servants in: Let nothing be mentioned out of doors, said he, of what has lately passed within, especially in the east apartment; the young Gentlemen had not so much reason to be frightened as they apprehended; a piece of furniture fell down in the rooms underneath, which made the noise that alarmed them so much: But I can certify that all things in the rooms are in quiet, and there is nothing to fear. All of you attend me in the chapel in an hour; 
[Page 119]
do your duties, put your trust in God, and obey your Lord, and you will find every thing go right as it used to do. 
I hey dispersed; the sun rose, the day came on, and every thing went on in the usual course: But the servants were not so easily satisfied; they whispered that something was wrong, and expected the time that should set all right. -The mind of the Baron was employed in meditating upon these circumstances, that seemed to him the forerunners of some great events: He sometimes thought of Edmund; he sighed for his expulsion, and lamented the uncertainty of his fate; but, to his family, he appeared easy and satisfied. 
From the time of Edmund's departure, the fair Emma had many uneasy hours; she wished to enquire after him, but feared to shew any solicitude concerning him: The next day, when her brother William came into her apartment, she took courage to ask a question. Pray, brother, can you give any guess what is become of Edmund? -No, said he (with a sigh); why do you ask me? -Because, my dear William, I should think if any body knew, it must be you; and I thought he loved you too well to leave you in ignorance: But don't you think he left the Castle in a very strange manner? ---I do, my dear; there is a mystery in every circumstance 
[Page 120]
of his departure: Nevertheless (I will trust you with a secret), he did not leave the Castle without making a distinction in my favour. -I thought so, said she; but you might tell me what you know about him. ---Alas, my dear Emma! I know nothing: When I saw him last, he seemed a good deal affected, as if he were taking leave of me; and I had a foreboding that we parted for a longer time than usual. ---Ah! so had I, said she, when he parted from me in the garden. ---What leave did he take of you, Emma? ---She blushed, and hesitated to tell him all that passed between them; but he begged, persuaded, insisted; and, at length, under the strongest injunctions of secrecy, she told him all. He said, that Edmund's behaviour on that occasion was as mystcrious as the rest of his conduct; but, now you have revealed your secret, you have a right to know mine. He then gave her the letter he found upon his pillow; she read it with great emotion. Saint Winifred assist me! said she; what can I think? ""--- that is to my thinking, Edmund lives, but is no peasant. ---Go on, my dear, said William; I like your explanation. -Nay, brother, I only guess; but what think you? -I believe we think alike in more than one respect, that he meant to recommend no other person than himself 
[Page 121]
to your favour; and, if he were indeed of noble birth, I would prefer him to a prince for a husband to my Emma! -Bless me! said she, do you think it possible that he should be of either birth or fortune? -It is hard to say what is impossible! we have proof that the east apartment is haunted: It was there that Edmund was made acquainted with many secrets, I doubt not; and, perhaps, his own fate may be involved in that of others. I am confident that what he saw and heard there, was the cause of his departure. We must wait with patience the unravelling this intricate affair: I believe I need not enjoin your secrecy as to what I have said; your heart will be my security. -What mean you, brother? -Don't affect ignorance, my dear; you love Edmund, so do I; it is nothing to be ashamed of: It would have been strange, if a girl of your good sense had not distinguished a swan among a flock of geese. -Dear William, don't let a word of this escape you; but you have taken a weight off my heart. You may depend that I will not dispose of my hand or heart till I know the end of this affair. William smiled: Keep them for Edmund's friend: I shall rejoice to see him in a situation to ask them. -Hush, my brother! not a word more; I hear footsteps. They were her eldest brother's, who came to ask Mr. William 
[Page 122]
to ride out with him, which finished the conference. 
The fair Emma from this time assumed an air of satisfaction; and William frequently stole away trom his companions to talk with his sister upon their favourite subject. 
While these things passed at the Castle of Lovel, Edmund and his companion John Wyatt proceeded on their journey to Sir Philip Harclay's seat; they conversed together on the way, and Edmund sound him a man of understanding, though not improved by education; he also discovered that John loved his Master, and respected him even to veneration; from him he learned many particulars concerning that worthy knight. Wyatt told him, that Sir Philip maintained twelve old soldiers who had been maimed and disabled in the wars, and had no provision made for them; also six old officers, who had been unfortunate, and were grown grey without preferment; he likewise mentioned the Greek Gentleman, his master's captive and friend, as a man eminent for valour and piety; but, beside these, said Wyatt, there are many others who eat of my Master's bread and drink of his cup, and who join in blessings and prayers to heaven for their noble benefactor; his ears are ever open to distress, his hand to relieve it, and he shares in every good man's joys 
[Page 123]
and blessings. -Oh, what a glorious character! said Edmund: how my heart throbs with wishes to imitate such a man! Oh that I might resemble him, though at ever so great a distance! Edmund was never weary of hearing the actions of this truly great man, nor Wyatt with relating them; and, during three days journey, there were but few pauses in their conversation. 
The fourth day, when they came within view of the house, Edmund's heart began to raise doubts of his reception. If, said he, Sir Philip should not receive me kindly, if he should resent my long neglect, and disown my acquaintance, it would be no more than justice. 
He sent Wyatt before, to notify his arrival to Sir Philip, while he waited at the gate, full of doubts and anxieties concerning his-reception. Wyatt was met and congratulated on his return by most of his fellow-servants; he asked, Where is my master? -In the parlour. -Are any strangers with him? -No, only his own family. -Then I will shew myself to him. He presented himself before Sir Philip. So, John, said he, you are welcome home! I hope you left your parents and relations well? -All well, thank God! and send their humble duty to your Honour, and they pray for you every day of their lives; I hope your honour is in good health. -Very well. ---Thank God for that! 
[Page 124]
but, Sir, I have something further to tell you: I have had a companion all the way home, a person who comes to wait on your honour, on business of great consequence, as he says. - Who is that, John? ---It is Master Edmund Twyford, from the Castle of Lovel. -Young Edmund! says Sir Philip, surprised: Where is he? ---At the gate, Sir. ---Why did you leave him there? ---Because he bad me come before, and acquaint your honour, that he waits your pleasure. ---Bring him hither, said Sir Philip; tell him I shall be glad to see him. 
John made haste to deliver his message, and Edmund followed him in silence into Sir Philip's presence: He bowed low, and kept at distance. Sir Philip held out his hand, and bad him approach. As he drew near, he was seized with an universal trembling; he kneeled down, took his hand, kissed it, and pressed it to his heart in silence. 
You are welcome, young man! said Sir Philip; take courage, and speak for yourself. Edmund sighed deeply; he at length broke silence with difficulty. I am come thus far, noble Sir, to throw myself at your feet, and implore your protection. You are, under God, my only reliance. ---I receive you, said Sir Philip, with all my heart! Your person is greatly improved since I saw you last, and I hope your mind is 
[Page 125]
equally so: I have heard a great character of you from some that knew you in France. I remember the promise I made you long ago, and am ready now to fulsil it, upon condition that you have done nothing to disgrace the good opinion I formerly entertained of you; and am ready to serve you in any thing consistent with my own honour. Edmund kissed the hand that was extended to raise him. I accept your favour, Sir, upon this condition only; and if ever you find me to impose upon your credulity, or incroach on your goodness, may you renounce me from that moment! Enough, said Sir Philip; rise, then, and let me embrace you: You are truly welcome! Oh, noble Sir! said Edmund, I have a strange story to tell you; but it must be by ourselves, with only heaven to bear witness to what passes between us. - Very well, said Sir Philip; I am ready to hear you: But first, go and get some refreshment after your journey, and then come to me again; John Wyatt will attend you. -I want no refreshment, said Edmund; and I cannot eat or drink till I have told my business to your honour. -Well then, said Sir Philip, come along with me. He took the youth by the hand, and led him into another parlour, leaving his friends in great surprise, what this young man's errand could be: John Wyatt told them all that he 
[Page 126]
knew relating to Edmund's birth, character, and situation. 
When Sir Philip had seated his young friend, he listened in silence to the surprising tale he had to tell him. Edmund told him briefly the most remarkable circumstances of his life, from the time when he first saw and liked him, till his return from France; but from that æra, he related at large every thing that had happened, recounting every interesting particular, which was imprinted on his memory in strong and lasting characters. -Sir Philip grew every moment more affected hy the recital; sometimes he clasped his hands together, he lifted them up to heaven, he smote his breast, he sighed, he exclaimed aloud; when Edmund related his dream, he breathed short, and seemed to devour him with attention; when he described the fatal closet, he trembled, sighed, sobbed, and was almost suffocated with his agitations: But when he related all that passed between his supposed mother and himself, and finally produced the jewels, the proofs of his birth, and the death of his unfortunate mother-he flew to him, he pressed him to his bosom, he strove to speak, but speech was for some minutes denied: He wept aloud; and, at length, his words found their way in broken exclamations. -Son of my dearest friend!- dear and precious relic of a noble house!- 
[Page 127]
child of providence!-the beloved of heaven! -welcome! thrice welcome to my arms!- to my heart! -I will be thy parent from henceforward, and thou shalt be indeed my child, my heir! My mind told me from the first moment I beheld thee, that thou wert the image of my friend! my heart then opened itself to receive thee, as his offspring. I had a strange foreboding that I was to be thy protector. I would then have made thee my own; but heaven orders things for the best; it made thee the instrument of this discovery, and in its own time and manner conducted thee to my arms. Praise be to God for his wonderful doings towards the children of men! every thing that has befallen thee is by his direction, and he will not leave his work unfinished; I trust that I shall be his instrument to do justice on the guilty, and to restore the orphan of my friend to his rights and title. I devote myself to this service, and will make it the business of my life to effect it. 
Edmund gave vent to his emotions, in raptures of joy and gratitude. They spent several hours in this way, without thinking of the time that passed; the one enquiring, the other explaining, and repeating, every particular of the interesting story. 

[Page 128]
At length they were interrupted by the careful John Wyatt, who was anxious to know if any thing was likely to give trouble to his Master. Sir, said John, it grows dark, do you want a light? -We want no light but what heaven gives us, said Sir Philip; I knew not whether it was dark or light. -I hope, said John, nothing has happened, I hope your honour has heard no bad tidings,-I-I-I hope no offence. -None at all, said the good knight; I am obliged to your solicitude for me: I have heard some things that grieve me, and others that give me great pleasure; but the sorrows are past, and the joys remain. -Thank God! said John; I was afraid something was the matter to give your honour trouble. -I thank you, my good servant! You see this young gentleman; I would have you, John, devote yourself to his service: I give you to him for an attendant on his person, and would have you show your affection to me by your attachment to him. -Oh, Sir! said John in a melancholy voice, what have I done to be turned out of your service? -No such matter, John, said Sir Philip; you will not leave my service. -Sir, said John, I would rather die than leave you. -And, my lad, I like you too well to part with you; but in serving my friend you will serve me: Know, that this young man is my son. - 
[Page 129]
Your son, Sir! said John. -Not my natural son, but my relation; my son by adoption, my heir! -And will he live with you, Sir? -Yes, John; and I hope to die with him. -Oh, then, I will serve him with all my heart and soul; and I will do my best to please you both. -I thank you, John, and I will not forget your honest love and duty: I have so good an opinion of you, that I will tell you of some things concerning this gentleman that will entitle him to your respect. -'Tis enough for me, said John, to know that your honour respects him, to make me pay him as much duty as yourself. -But, John, when you know him better, you will respect him still more; at present, I shall only tell you what he is not; for you think him only the son of Andrew Twyford. -And is he not? said John. -No; but his wife nursed him, and he passed for her son. -And does old Twyford know it, Sir? -He does, and will bear witness to it; but he is the son of a near friend of mine, of quality superior to my own, and as such you must serve and respect him. -I shall, to be sure, Sir; but what name shall I call him? -You shall know that hereafter; in the mean time bring a light, and wait on us to the other parlour. 
When John was withdrawn, Sir Philip said, that is a point to be considered and determined 
[Page 130]
immediately: It is proper that you should assume a name till you can take that of your father; for I choose you should drop that of your foster-father; and I would have you be called by one that is respectable. -In that, and every other point, I will be wholly governed by you, Sir, said Edmund. -Well then, I will give you the name of Seagrave: I shall say that you are a relation of my own; and my mother was really of that family. 
John soon returned, and attended them into the other parlour: Sir Philip entered, with Edmund in his hand. -My friends, said he, this gentleman is Mr. Edward Seagrave, the son of a dear friend and relation of mine: He was lost in his infancy, brought up by a good woman out of pure humanity, and is but lately restored to his own family: The circumstances shall be made known hereafter: In the mean time, I have taken him under my care and protection, and will use all my power and interest to see him restored to his fortune, which is enjoyed by the usurper who was the cause of his expulsion, and the death of his parents. Receive him as my relation, and friend: Zadisky, do you embrace him first. Edmund, you and this gentleman must love each other for my sake; hereafter you will do it for your own. They all rose, each embraced and congratulated the young 
[Page 131]
man. Zadisky said, Sir, whatever griefs and misfortunes you may have endured, you may reckon them at an end, from the hour you are beloved and protected by Sir Philip Harclay. -I firmly believe it, Sir, replied Edmund; and my heart enjoys, already, more happiness than I ever yet felt, and promises me all that I can wish in future: His friendship is the earnest Heaven gives me of its blessings hereafter. 
They sat down to supper with mutual cheerfulness; and Edmund enjoyed the repast with more satisfaction than he had felt a long time. Sir Philip saw his countenance brighten up, and looked on him with heart-felt pleasure. Every time I look on you, said he, reminds me of your father; you are the same person I loved twenty-three years ago: I rejoice to see you under my roof. Go to your repose early, and to-morrow we will consult farther. Edmund withdrew, and enjoyed a night of sweet undisturbed repose. 
The next morning Edmund arose in perfect health and spirits; he waited on his benefactor. They were soon after joined by Zadisky, who shewed great attention and respect to the youth, and offered him his best services without reserve. Edmund accepted them with equal respect and modesty; and finding himself at ease, began to display his amiable qualities. They 
[Page 132]
breakfasted together; afterwards, Sir Philip desired Edmund to walk out with him. 
As soon as they were out of hearing, Sir Philip said, I could not sleep last night for thinking of your affairs; I laid schemes for you, and rejected them again. We must lay our plan before we begin to act. What shall be done with this treacherous kinsman! this inhuman monster! this assassin of his nearest relation? I will risk my life and fortune to bring him to justice. Shall I go to court, and demand justice of the King? or shall I accuse him of the murder, and make him stand a public trial? If I treat him as a Baron of the realm, he must be tried by his peers; if as a commoner, he must be tried at the county assize: But we must shew reason why he should be degraded from his title. Have you any thing to propose? -Nothing, Sir; I have only to wish that it might be as private as possible, for the sake of my noble benefactor, the Lord Fitz-Owen, upon whom some part of the family disgrace would naturally fall; and that would be an ill return for all his kindness and generosity to me. -That is a generous and grateful consideration on your part; but you owe still more to the memory of your injured parents. However, there is yet another way that suits me better than any hitherto proposed: I will challenge the traitor to meet me in the field; and, if he has spirit enough to answer my 
[Page 133]
call, I will there bring him to justice; if not, I will bring him to a public trial. 
No, Sir, said Edmund, that is my province: Should I stand by and see my noble, gallant friend expose his life for me, I should be unworthy to bear the name of that friend whom you so much lament. It will become his son to vindicate his name, and revenge his death. I will be the challenger, and no other. -And do you think he will answer the challenge of an unknown youth, with nothing but his pretensions to his name and title? Certainly not. Leave this matter to me: I think of a way that will oblige him to meet me at the house of a third person who is known to all the parties concerned, and where we will have authentic witnesses of all that passes between him and me. I will devise the time, place, and manner, and satisfy all your scruples. Edmund offered to reply; but Sir Philip bad him be silent, and let him proceed in his own way. 
He then led him over his estate, and shewed him every thing deserving his notice; he told him all the particulars of his domestic occonomy, and they returned home in time to meet their friends at dinner. 
They spent several days in consulting how to bring Sir Walter to account, and in improving their friendship and confidence in each other. 
[Page 134]
Edmund endeared himself so much to his friend and patron, that he declared him his adopted son and heir before all his friends and servants, and ordered them to respect him as such. He every day improved their love and regard for him, and became the darling of the whole family. 
After much consideration, Sir Philip fixed his resolutions, and began to execute his purposes. He set out for the seat of the Lord Clifford, attended by Edmund, M. Zadisky, and two servants. Lord Clifford received them with kindness and hospitality. 
Sir Philip presented Edmund to Lord Clifford and his family, as his near relation and presumptive heir: They spent the evening in the pleasures of convivial mirth and hospitable entertainment. The next day Sir Philip began to open his mind to Lord Clifford, informing him that both his young friend and himself had received great injuries from the present Lord Lovel, for which they were resolved to call him to account; but that, for many reasons, they were desirous to have proper witnesses of all that should pass between them, and begging the favour of his Lordship to be the principal one. Lord Clifford acknowledged the confidence placed in him; and besought Sir Philip to let him be the arbitrator between them. Sir Philip assured him, that their wrongs would not admit of 
[Page 135]
arbitration, as he should hereafter judge; but that he was unwilling to explain them further till he knew certainly whether or not the Lord Lovel would meet him; for, if he refused, he must take another method with him. 
Lord Clifford was desirous to know the grounds of the quarrel; but Sir Philip declined entering into particulars at present, assuring him of a full information hereafter. He then sent M. Zadisky, attended by John Wyatt, and a servant of Lord Clifford, with a letter to Lord Lovel; the contents were as follows: 

""Sir Philip Harclay earnestly desires to see you at the house of Lord Clifford, where he waits to call you to account for the injuries done by you to the late Arthur Lord Lovel, your kinsman: If you accept his demand, he will make the Lord Clifford a witness and a judge of the cause; if not, he will expose you publicly as a traitor and a coward. Please to answer this letter, and he will acquaint you with the time, place, and manner of the meeting. 
Philip Harclay.""Lord Lovel knows not of any injuries done by him to the late Arthur Lord Lovel, whom he succeeded by just right of inheritance; nor of any right Sir Philip Harclay has, to call to account a man to whom he is barely known, having seen him only once, many years ago, at the house of his uncle, the old Lord Lovel: Nevertheless, Lord Lovel will not suffer any man to call his name and honour into question with impunity; for which reason he will meet Sir Philip Harclay at any time, place, and in what manner he shall appoint, bringing the same number of friends and dependents, that justice may be done to all parties. 
Lovel.""I Philip Harclay, Knight, challenge Walter, commonly called Lord Lovel, as a base, treacherous, and bloody man, who, by his wicked arts and devices, did kill, or cause to be killed, his kinsman, Arthur Lord Lovel, my dear and noble friend. I am called upon, in an extraordinary manner, to revenge his death; and I will prove the truth of what I have affirmed at the peril of my life.""I Walter, Baron of Lovel, do deny the charge against me, and affirm it to be a base, false, and malicious accusation of this Sir Philip Harclay, which I believe to be invented by himself, or else framed by some enemy, and told to him for wicked ends; but, be that as it may, I will maintain my own honour, and prove him to be a false 
[Page 147]
traitor, at the hazard of my own life, and to the punishment of his presumption.""Right Hon. my good Lord, 
""Clifford.""The Heir of Lovel, to his dear and reverend friend, father Oswald. 
Let my friends at the Castle of Lovel know that I live in hopes one day to see them there. 
[Page 168]
If you could by any means return with the messengers, your testimony would add weight to mine; perhaps you might obtain permission to attend the Baron: I leave it to you to manage this. John Wyatt will inform you of all that has passed here, and that hitherto my success has outrun my expectation, and, almost, my wishes. I am in the high road to my inheritance; and trust that the Power who hath conducted me thus far, will not leave his work unfinished. Tell my beloved William, that I live, and hope to embrace him before long. I recommend myself to your holy prayers and blessing, and remain your son and servant, 
Edmund.""Praye for the soules of Arthur Lord Lovele and Marie his wife, who were cut off in the flowere of theire youthe, by the trecherye and 
[Page 220]
crueltie of theire neare kinnesmanne. Edmunde theire onlie sonne, one and twentie yeares after theire deathe, by the direction of Heavene, made the discoverye of the mannere of theire deathe, and at the same time proved his owne birthe. He collected theire bones together, and interred them in this place:- A warning and proofe to late posteritie, of the justice of Providence, and the certaintie of Retribution." 
The Sunday after the funeral, Edmund threw off his mourning, and appeared in a dress suitable to his condition. He received the compliments of his friends with ease and cheerfulness, and began to enjoy his happiness. He asked an audience of his fair Mistress, and was permitted to declare the passion he had so long stifled in his own bosom. She gave him a favourable hearing, and in a short time confessed that she had suffered equally in that suspense that was so grievous to him. They engaged themselves by mutual vows to each other, and only waited the Baron's pleasure to complete their happiness; every cloud was vanished from their brows, and sweet tranquillity took possession of their bosoms. Their friends shared their happiness; William and Edmund renewed their vows of everlasting friendship, and promised to be as much together as William's other duties would permit. 

[Page 221]
The Baron once more summoned all his company together; he told Edmund all that had passed relating to his brother in-law, his exile, and the pilgrimage of Zadisky; he then related the circumstances of Sir Robert's engagement to Lord Clifford's daughter, his establishment in his Uncle's seat, and his own obligations to return time enough to be present at the marriage: But before I go, said he, I will give my daughter to the Heir of Lovel, and then I shall have discharged my duty to him, and my promise to Sir Philip Harclay. 
You have nobly performed both, said Sir Philip, and whenever you depart I shall be your companion. -What, said Edmund, am I to be deprived of both my fathers at once? My honoured Lord, you have given away two houses, where do you intend to reside? -No matter, said the Baron; I know I shall be welcome to both. -My dear Lord, said Edmund, stay here and be still the Master; I shall be proud to be under your command, and to be your servant as well as your son! -No, Edmund, said the Baron, that would not now be proper; this is your Castle, you are its Lord and Master, and it is incumbent on you to shew yourself worthy of the great things Providence has done for you. -How shall I, a young man, acquit myself of so many duties as will be upon me, without the 
[Page 222]
advice and assistance of my two paternal friends? Oh, Sir Philip! will you too leave me? once you gave me hopes-he stopped, greatly affected. Sir Philip said, Tell me truly, Edmund, do you really desire that I should live with you? -As truly, Sir, as I desire life and happiness! - Then, my dear child, I will live and die with you! They embraced with tears of affection, and Edmund was all joy and gratitude. My good Lord, said Sir Philip, you have disposed of two houses, and have none ready to receive you; will you accept of mine? it is much at your service, and its being in the same county with your eldest son, will be an inducement to you to reside there. The Baron caught Sir Philip's hand-Noble Sir, I thank you, and I will embrace your kind offer; I will be your tenant for the present; my castle in Wales shall be put in repair, in the mean time; if I do not reside there, it will be an establishment for one of my younger sons: But what will you do with your old soldiers and dependants? -My Lord, I will never cast them off. There is another house on my estate that has been shut up many years; I will have it repaired and furnished properly for the reception of my old men: I will endow it with a certain sum to be paid annually, and will appoint a steward to manage their revenue; I will continue it during the lives of the 
[Page 223]
first inhabitants, and after that I shall leave it to my son here, to do as he pleases. -Your son, said Edmund, will make it the business of his life to act worthy of such a father. -Enough, said Sir Philip, I am satisfied that you will. I purpose to reside myself in that very apartment which my dear friend your father inhabited; I will tread in his footsteps, and think he sees me acting his part in his son's family. I will be attended by my own servants; and, whenever you desire it, I will give you my company; your joys, your griefs shall be mine, I shall hold your children in my arms, and their prattle shall amuse my old age: And, as my last earthly wish, your hands shall close my eyes. -Long, very long, said Edmund (with eyes and hands lifted up), may it be ere I perform so sad a duty! -Long and happily may you live together, said the Baron! I will hope to see you sometimes, and to claim a share in your blessings. But let us give no more tears to sorrow, the rest shall be those of joy and transport. The first step we take shall be to marry our Edmund; I will give orders for the celebration, and they shall be the last orders I shall give in this house. They then separated, and went to prepare for the approaching solemnity. 
Sir Philip and the Baron had a private conference concerning Edmund's assuming the 
[Page 224]
name and title of Lovel. I am resolved, said Sir Philip, to go to the King; to acquaint him briefly with Edmund's history; I will request that he may be called up to parliament by a writ, for there is no need of a new patent, he being the true inheritor; in the mean time he shall assume the name, arms, and title, and I will answer any one that shall dispute his right to them. Sir Philip then declared his resolution to set out with the Baron at his departure, and to settle all his other affairs before he returned to take up his residence at the Castle. 
A few days after, the marriage was celebrated, to the entire satisfaction of all parties. The Baron ordered the doors to be thrown open, and the house free for all comers; with every other token of joy and festivity. Edmund appeared full of joy without levity, of mirth without extravagance; he received the congratulations of his friends, with ease, freedom, and vivacity. He sent for his foster father and mother, who began to think themselves neglected, as he had been so deeply engaged in affairs of more consequence that he had not been particularly attentive to them; he made them come into the great hall, and presented them to his Lady. 
These, said he, are the good people to whom I am, under God, indebted for my present 
[Page 225]
happiness; they were my first benefactors; I was obliged to them for food and sustenance in my childhood, and this good woman nourished my infancy at her own breast. The lady received them graciously, and saluted Margery. Andrew kneeled down, and, with great humility, begged Edmund's pardon for his treatment of him in his childhood. I heartily forgive you, said he, and I will excuse you to yourself; it was natural for you to look upon me as an intruder, that was eating your children's bread; you saved my life, and afterwards you sustained it by your food and raiment: I ought to have maintained myself, and to have contributed to your maintenance. But, besides this, your treatment of me was the first of my preferment; it recommended me to the notice of this noble family: Every thing that happened to me since, has been a step to my present state of honour and happiness. Never man had so many benefactors as myself; but both they, and myself, have been only instruments in the hands of Providence, to bring about its own purposes: Let us praise God for all! I shared your poverty, and you will share my riches; I will give you the cottage where you dwell, and the ground about it; I will also pay you the annual sum of ten pounds for the lives of you both; I will put out your children to manual trades, and 
[Page 226]
assist you to provide for them in their own station; and you are to look upon this as paying a debt, and not bestowing a gift: I owe you more than I can ever pay: and, if there be any thing further in my power that will contribute to your happiness, you can ask nothing in reason that I will deny you. 
Andrew hid his face: I cannot bear it! said he; Oh what a brute was I, to abuse such a child as this! I shall never forgive myself! - You must indeed, my friend, for I forgive and thank you. Andrew retired back, but Margery came forward; she looked earnestly on Edmund, she then threw her arms about his neck, and wept aloud-My precious child! my lovely babe! thank God, I have lived to see this day! I will rejoice in your good fortune, and your bounty to us, but I must ask one more favour yet; that I may sometimes come hither and behold that gracious countenance, and thank God that I was honoured so far as to give thee food from my own breast, and to bring thee up to be a blessing to me, and to all that know thee! Edmund was affected, he returned her embrace; he bade her come to the Castle as often as she pleased, and she should always be received as his mother; the bride saluted her, and told her the oftener she came, the more welcome she should be. Margery and her husband retired, 
[Page 227]
full of blessings and prayers for their happiness; she gave vent to her joy, by relating to the servants and neighbours every circumstance of Edmund's birth, infancy, and childhood: Many a tear was dropped by the auditors, and many a prayer wafted to Heaven for his happiness. Joseph took up the story where she left it; he told the rising dawn of youth and virtue, darting its ray through the clouds of obscurity, and how every stroke of envy and malignity brushed away some part of the darkness that veiled its lustre: He told the story of the haunted apartment, and all the consequences of it; how he and Oswald conveyed the youth away from the Castle, no more to return till he came as master of it: He closed the tale with praise to Heaven for the happy discovery, that gave such an heir to the house of Lovel; to his dependants such a Lord and Master; to mankind a friend and benefactor. There was truly a house of joy; not that false kind, in the midst of which there is heaviness, but that of rational creatures, grateful to the supreme Benefactor, raising their minds by a due enjoyment of earthly blessings to a preparation for a more perfect state hereafter. 
A few days after the wedding, the Lord Fitz-Owen began to prepare for his journey to the north. He gave to Edmund the plate, linen, and furniture of the Castle, the farming 
[Page 228]
stock and utensils; he would have added a sum of money, but Sir Philip stopped his hand: We do not forget, said he, that you have other children, we will not suffer you to injure them; give us your blessing and paternal affection, and we have nothing more to ask: I told you, my Lord, that you and I should one day be sincere friends. -We must be so, answered the Baron; it is impossible to be long your enemy: We are brothers, and shall be to our lives end. 
They regulated the young man's household; the Baron gave leave to the servants to choose their master; the elder ones followed him (except Joseph, who desired to live with Edmund, as the chief happiness of his life); most of the younger ones chose the service of the youthful pair. There was a tender and affectionate parting on all sides. Edmund besought his beloved William not to leave him. The Baron said, he must insist on his being at his brother's wedding, as a due attention to him; but after that he should return to the Castle for some time. 
The Baron and Sir Philip Harclay, with their train, set forward. Sir Philip went to London and obtained all he desired for his Edmund; from thence he went into Yorkshire, and settled his affairs there, removing his pensioners to his other house, and putting Lord Fitz-Owen 
[Page 229]
in possession of his own. They had a generous contention about the terms; but Sir Philip insisted on the Baron's accepting the use of every thing there: You hold it in trust for a future grandchild, said he, whom I hope to live to endow with it. 
During Sir Philip's absence, the young Lord Lovel caused the haunted apartment to be repaired and furnished for the reception of his father by adoption. He placed his friend Joseph over all his men servants, and ordered him to forbear his attendance; but the old man would always stand at the side board, and feast his eyes with the countenance of his own Master's son, surrounded with honour and happiness. John Wyatt waited upon the person of his Lord, and enjoyed his favour without abatement. Mr. William Fitz-Owen accompanied Sir Philip Harclay from the north country, when he returned to take up his residence at the Castle of Lovel. 
Edmund, in the arms of love and friendship, enjoyed with true relish the blessings that surrounded him, with an heart overflowing with benevolence to his fellow creatures, and raptures of gratitude to his Creator. His Lady and himself were examples of conjugal affection and happiness. Within a year from his marriage she brought him a son and heir, whose birth renewed the joy and congratulations of 
[Page 230]
all his friends: The Baron Fitz-Owen came to the baptism, and partook of his children's blessings. The child was called Arthur, after the name of his grandfather. 
The year following was born a second son, who was called Philip Harclay; upon him the noble knight of that name settled his estate in Yorkshire; and by the king's permission, he took the name and arms of that family. 
The third son was called William; he inherited the fortune of his uncle of that name, who adopted him, and he made the Castle of Lovel his residence, and died a bachelor. 
The fourth son was called Edmund; the fifth Owen; and there was also a daughter called Emma. 
When time had worn out the prejudices of Sir Robert Fitz-Owen, the good old Baron of that name proposed a marriage between his eldest son and heir, and the daughter of Edmund Lord Lovel, which was happily concluded. The nuptials were honoured with the presence of both families; and the Old Baron was so elevated with this happy union of his descendants, that he cried out-Now I am ready to die! I have lived long enough! this is the band of love that unites all my children to me, and to each other! He did not long survive this happy event; he died full of years and honours, and his name was never mentioned 
[Page 231]
but with the deepest marks of gratitude, love and veneration. Sweet is the remembrance of the virtuous, and happy are the descendants of such a father! they will think on him and emulate his virtues; they will remember him, and be ashamed to degenerate from their ancestor. 
Many years after Sir Philip Harclay settled at the Castle, he received tidings from his friend Zadisky, by one of the two servants who attended him to the Holy Land. From him he learned that his friend had discovered, by private advices, that he had a son living in Palestine, which was the chief motive of his leaving England; that he had met with various adventures in pursuit of him; that at length he found him, converted him to the christian religion, and then persuaded him to retire from the world into a monastery by the side of mount Libanus, where he intended to end his days. 
That Walter, commonly called Lord Lovel, had entered into the service of the Greek emperor, John Paleologus, not bearing to undergo a life of solitude and retirement; that he made up a story of his being compelled to leave his native country by his relations, for having accidentally killed one of them, and that he was treated with great cruelty and injustice; that he had accepted a post in the emperor's 
[Page 232]
army, and was soon after married to the daughter of one of the chief officers of it. 
Zadisky foresaw, and lamented the downfal of that empire, and withdrew from the storm he saw approaching. Finally, he bade the messenger tell Sir Philip Harclay and his adopted son, that he should not cease to pray for them, and desired their prayers in return. 
Sir Philip desired Lord Lovel to entertain this messenger in his service. That good knight lived to extreme old age in honour and happiness, and died in the arms of his beloved Edmund; who also performed the last duties to his faithful Joseph. 
Father Oswald lived many years in the family as chaplain; he retired from thence at length, and died in his own monastery. 
Edmund Lord Lovel lived to old age, in peace, honour and happiness; and died in the arms of his children. 
Sir Philip Harclay caused the papers relating to his son's history to be collected together; the first part of it was written under his own eye in Yorkshire, the subsequent parts by father Oswald at the Castle of Lovel. All these, when together, furnish a striking lesson to posterity, of the over-ruling hand of Providence, and the certainty of RETRIBUTION.
