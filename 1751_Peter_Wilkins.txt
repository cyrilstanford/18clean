THE INTRODUCTION. 
It might be looked upon as impertinent in me, who am about to give the Life of another, to trouble the Reader with any of my own Concerns, or the Affairs that led me into the South-Seas. Therefore, I shall only acquaint him, that in my Return on board the Hector, as a Passenger, round Cape Horn, for England, full late in the Season, the Wind and Currents setting strong against us, our Ship drove more southerly by several 
[Page iv]
Degrees than the usual Course, even to the Latitude of 75 or 76; when, the Wind chopping about, we began to resume our intended Way. It was about the Middle of June, when the Days are there at the shortest, on a very starry and Moon-light Night, that we observed at some Distance a very black Cloud, but seemingly of no extraordinary Size or Height, moving very fast towards us, and seeming to follow the Ship, which then made great Way. Every one on Deck was very curious in observing its Motions; and perceiving it frequently to divide, and presently to close again, and not to continue long in any determined Shape, our Captain, who had never before been so far to the Southward as he then found himself, had many Conjectures what this Phenomenon might portend; and every one offering his own Opinion, it seemed at last to be generally agreed, that there might possibly be a Storm gathering in the Air, of which this was the Prognostick; and by its following, and nearly keeping Pace with us, we were in great Fear lest it should break 
[Page v]
upon and overwhelm us, if not carefully avoided. Our Commander therefore, as it approached nearer and nearer, ordered one of the Ship's Guns to be fired, to try if the Percussion of the Air would disperse it. This was no sooner done, than we heard a prodigious Flounce in the Water, at but a small Distance from the Ship, on the Weather Quarter; and after a violent Noise, or Cry in the Air, the Cloud, that upon our firing dissipated, seemed to return again, but by Degrees disappeared. Whilst we were all very much surprized at this unexpected Accident, I, being naturally very curious, and inquisitive into the Causes of all unusual Incidents, begged the Captain to send the Boat, to see, if possible, what it was that had fallen from the Cloud, and offered myself to make one in her. He was much against this at first, as it would retard his Voyage, now we were going so smoothly before the Wind. But in the Midst of our Debate, we plainly heard a Voice calling out for Help, in our own Tongue, like a Person in great Distress. 
[Page vi]
I then insisted on going, and not suffering a Fellow-Creature to perish for the Sake of a trifling Delay. In compliance with my resolute Demand, he slackened Sail; and hoisting out the Boat, myself and seven others made to the Cry; and soon found it to come from an elderly Man, labouring for Life, with his Arms across several long Poles, of equal Size at both Ends, very light, and tied to each other in a very odd Manner. The Sailors at first were very fearful of assisting, or coming near him; crying to each other, he must be a Monster, and perhaps might overset the Boat and destroy them; but hearing him speak English, I was very angry with them for their foolish Apprehensions, and caused them to clap their Oars under him; and at length we got him into the Boat. He had an extravagant Beard, and also long blackish Hair upon his Head. As soon as he could speak (for he was almost spent) he very familiarly took me by the Hand, I having set myself close by him to observe him, and squeezing it, thanked 
[Page vii]
me very kindly for my Civility to him, and likewise thanked all the Sailors. I then asked him by what possible Accident he came there; but he shook his Head, declining to satisfy my Curiosity. Hereupon reflecting, that it might just then be troublesome for him to speak, and that we should have Leisure enough in our Voyage for him to relate, and me to hear, his Story, (which, from the surprizing Manner of his falling amongst us, I could not but believe would contain something very remarkable) I waved any further Speech with him at that Time. 
We had him to the Ship, and taking off his wet Clothes, put him to Bed in my Cabbin; and I having a large Provision of Stores on board, and no Concern in the Ship, grew very fond of him, and supplied him with every thing he wanted. In our frequent Discourses together he had several Times dropped loose Hints of his past Transactions, which but the more inflamed me with Impatience to hear the Whole of them. About this Time, having just begun to double the Cape, our 
[Page viii]
Captain thought of watering at the first convenient Place; and finding the Stranger had no Money to pay his Passage, and that he had been from England no less than thirty-five Years, despairing of his Reward for conducting him thither, he intimated to him, that he must expect to be put on shore, to shift for himself, when we put in for Water. This intirely sunk the Stranger's Spirits, and gave me great Concern; insomuch that I fully resolved, if the Captain should really prove such a Brute, to take the Payment of his Passage on myself. 
As we came nearer to the destined Watering, the Captain spoke the plainer of his Intentions, (for I had not yet hinted my Design to him, or any one else;) and one Morning the Stranger came into my Cabbin, with Tears in his Eyes, telling me, he verily believed the Captain would be as good as his Word, and set him on shore, which he very much dreaded. I did not chuse to tell him immediately what I designed in his Favour, but asked 
[Page ix]
him if he could think of no Way of satisfying the Captain, or any one else who might thereupon be induced to engage for him; and further, how he expected to live when he should get to England, a Man quite forgotten and penny-less? Hereupon he told me, he had ever since his being on board, considering his destitute Condition, entertained a Thought of having his Adventures written; which, as there was something so uncommon in them, he was sure the World would be glad to know; and he had flattered himself with Hopes of raising somewhat by the Sale of them to put him in a Way of Living: But, as it was plain now, he should never see England without my Assistance; if I would answer for his Passage, and write his Life, he would communicate to me a faithful Narrative thereof, which he believed would pay me to the full, any Charge I might be at on his Account. I was very well pleased with this Overture; not from the Prospect of Gain by the Copy, but from the Expectation 
[Page x]
I had of being fully satisfied in what I had so long desired to know. So I told him I would make him easy in that Respect. This quite transported him. He caressed me, and called me his Deliverer; and was then going open-mouthed to the Captain to tell him so; but I put a Stop to that; for, says I, (though I insist upon hearing your Story) the Captain may yet relent of his Purpose, and not leave you on shore; and if that should prove the Case, I shall neither part with my Money for you, nor you with your Interest in your Adventures to me: Whereupon he agreed I was right, and desisted. 
When we had taken in best Part of our Water, and the Boat was going its last Turn, the Captain ordered up the strange Man, as they called him, and told him he must go on board the Boat, which was to leave him on shore, with some few Provisions. I happening to hear nothing of these Orders, they were so sudden, the poor Man was afraid, after all, he should have been hurried to Land without my Knowledge; but begging very hard of the Captain only for Leave to speak with 
[Page xi]
me before he went, I was called, (though with some Reluctance; for the Captain disliked me, for the Liberties I frequently took with him, on account of his brutal Behaviour.) I expostulated with the cruel Wretch on the Inhumanity of the Action he was about; telling him, if he had resolved the poor Man should perish, it would have been better to have suffered him to do so, when he was at the last Extremity, than to expose him afresh, by this Means, to a Death as certain, in a more lingering and miserable Way. But the Savage being resolved, and nothing moved by what I said, I paid him Part of the Passage down, and agreed to pay the rest at our Arrival in England. 
Thus having reprieved the poor Man, the next Thing was to enter upon my new Employ of Amanuensis. And having a long Space of Time before us, we allotted two Hours every Morning for the Purpose of writing down his Life from his own Mouth; and frequently, when Wind and Weather kept us below, we 
[Page xii]
spent some Time of an Afternoon in the same Exercise, till we had quite compleated it. But then there were some Things in it so indescribable by Words, that if I had not had some Knowledge also in Drawing, our History had been very incompleat. Thus it must have been, especially, in the Description of the Glumms and Gawrys therein mentioned. In order to gain (that so I might communicate) a clear Idea of these, I made several Drawings of them, in all the Forms and Attitudes I could conceive from his Discourses and Accounts; and at length, after divers Trials, I made such exact Delineations, that he declared they could not have been more perfect Resemblances, if I had drawn them from the Life. Upon a Survey, he confessed the very Persons themselves could not have been more exact. I also drew with my Pencil the Figure of an aireal Engagement, which, having likewise had his Approbation, I have given a Draught of, Plate the sixth. 

[Page xiii]
Then, having finished the Work to our mutual Satisfaction, I locked it up, in order to peruse it at Leisure, intending to have presented it to him at our Arrival in England, to dispose of as he pleased, in such a Way as might have conduced most to his Profit; for I resolved, notwithstanding our Agreement, and the Obligations he was under to me, that the Whole of that should be his own. But he, having been in a declining State sometime before we reached shore, died the very Night we landed; and his Funeral falling upon me, I thought I had the greatest Right to the Manuscript: Which however, I had no Design to have parted with; but shewing it to some judicious Friends, I have by them been prevailed with, not to conceal from the World, what may prove so very entertaining, and perhaps useful.

A GENUINE ACCOUNT OF THE LIFE OF PETER WILKINS.
CHAP. I. 

Giving an Account of the Author's Birth and Family; the Fondness of his Mother; his being put to an Academy at sixteen by the Advice of his Friend; his Thoughts of his own Illiterature. 
I was born at Penhale, in the County of Cornwall, on the 21st Day of December, 1685, about four Months after my Father Peter Wilkins, who was a zealous Protestant, of the Church of England, had been executed by Jefferys, in Somersetshire, for joining in the Design of raising the Duke of Monmouth 
[Page 2]
to the British Throne. I was named, after my Father and Grand father, Peter, and was my Father's only Child by Alice his Wife, the Daughter of John Capert, a Clergyman in a neighbouring Village. My Grandfather was a Shopkeeper at Newport, who, by great Frugality, and extraordinary Application, had raised a Fortune of about one hundred and sixty Pounds a Year in Lands, and a considerable Sum of ready Money; all which at his Death devolved upon my Father, as his only Child; who being no less parsimonious than my Grandfather, and living upon his own Estate, had much improved it in Value, before his Marriage with my Mother; but, he coming to that unhappy End, my Mother, after my Birth, placed all her Affection upon me, (her growing Hopes as she call'd me) and used every Method, in my Minority, of encreasing the Store for my Benefit. 
In this Manner she went on, till I grew too big, as I thought, for Confinement at the Apron-string, being then about fourteen Years of Age; and having met with so much Indulgence from her, for that Reason, found very little or no Contradiction from any body else; so I looked on myself as a Person of some Consequence, and began to take all Opportunities of enjoying the Company of my Neighbours, who hinted, frequently, that the Restraint I was under, was too great a Curb upon an Inclination like mine of seeing the World; but my Mother, still impatient of any little Absence, 
[Page 3]
by excessive Fondness, and encouraging of every Inclination I seemed to have, when she could be a Partaker with me, kept me within Bounds of Restraint, till I arrived at my sixteenth Year. 
About this time I got acquainted with a Country-Gentleman, of a small paternal Estate, which had been never the better for being in his Hands, and had some uneasy Demands upon it. He soon grew very fond of me, hoping, as I had Reason afterwards to believe, by a Union with my Mother, to set himself free from his Intanglements. She was then about Thirty-five Years old, and still continued my Father's Widow, out of particular regard to me, as I have all the Reason in the World to believe. She was really a beautiful Woman, and of a sanguine Complexion; but had always carried herself with so much Reserve, and given so little Encouragement to any of the other Sex, that she had passed her Widowhood with very few Solicitations to alter her Way of Life. This Gentleman, observing my Mother's Conduct, in order to ingratiate himself with her, had shewn numberless Instances of Regard for me, and, as he told my Mother, had observed many Things in my Discourse, Actions, and Turn of Mind, that presaged wonderful Expectations from me, if my Genius was but properly cultivated. 
This Discourse, from a Man of very good Parts, and esteemed by every body an accomplished 
[Page 4]
Gentleman, by Degrees wrought upon my Mother, and more and more inflamed her with a Desire of adding what Lustre she could to my applauded abilities, and influenced her so far as to ask his Advice in what Manner most properly to proceed with me. My Gentleman then had his Desire; for, he feared not the Widow, could he but properly dispose of her Charge; so, having desired a little Time to consider of a Matter of such Importance, he soon after told her, he thought the most useful Method of establishing me, would be at an Academy, kept by a very worthy and judicious Gentleman, about thirty or more Miles from us, in Somersetshire; where, if I could but be admitted, the Master taking in but a stated Number of Students at a Time, he did not in the least doubt, but I should fully answer the Character he had given her of me, and out-shine most of my Cotemporaries. 
My Mother, over-anxious for my good, seeming to listen to this Proposal, my Friend, as I call him, proposed taking a Journey himself to the Academy, to see if any Place was vacant for my Reception, and learn the of my Admission; and in three Days Time returned with an engaging Account of the Place, the Master, the Regularity of the Scholars, of an Apartment secured for my Reception, and, in short, whatever else might captivate my Mother's Opinion in Favour of his Scheme; and indeed, tho' he acted principally from another Motive, as was plain afterwards, I 
[Page 5]
can't help thinking, he believed it to be the best way of disposing of a Lad, sixteen Years old, born to a pretty Fortune, and who, at that Age, could but just read a Chapter in the Testament: For he had before beat my Mother quite out of her Inclination to a Grammar School in the Neighbourhood, from a Contempt, he said, it would bring upon me, from Lads much my Juniors in Years, by being placed in the first Rudiments of Learning with them. 
Well, the whole Concern of my Mother's little Family was now employed in sitting me out for my Expedition; and as my Friend had been so instrumental in bringing it about, he never missed a Day enquiring how Preparations went on, and, during the Process, by humouring me, ingratiated himself more and more with my Mother; but without seeming in the least to aim at it. 
In short, the Hour of my Departure arrived; and tho' I had never been Master of above Sixpence at one Time, unless at a Fair, or so, for immediate spending, my Mother, thinking to make my Heart easy at our Separation, which had it appeared otherwise, would have broke hers, and spoiled all, gave me a double Pistole in Gold, and a little Silver in my Pocket to prevent my changing it. 
Thus I, the Coach waiting for us at the Door, having been preached into a good liking of the Scheme by my Friend, who now insisted upon 
[Page 6]
making one of our Company to introduce us, mounted the Carriage with more Alacrity than could be expected for one who had never before been beyond the Smoak of his Mother's Chimney; but the Thoughts I had conceived, from my Friend's Discourse, of Liberty in the Academick Way, and the Weight of so much Money in my Pocket, as I then imagined would scarce ever be exhausted, were prevailing Cordials to keep my Spirits on the Wing. We lay at an Inn that Night, near the Master's House, and the next Day I was initiated; and, at parting with me, my Friend presented me with a Guinea. When I found myself thus rich, I must say, I heartily wished they were all fairly at home again; that I might have Time to count my Cash, and dispose of such Part of it as I had already appropriated to several Uses then in Embryo. 
The next Morning left me Master of my Wishes: For my Mother came and took her last (tho' she little thought it) Leave of me, and smothering me with her Caresses and Prayers for my well-doing, in the Heighth of her Ardour, put into my Hand another Guinea, promising to see me again quickly; and desiring me, in the mean time, to be a very good Husband, which I have since taken to be a Sort of prophetick Speech, She bid me farewell. 
I shall not trouble you with the Reception I met from my Master, or his Scholars; or tell you, how soon I made Friends of all my 
[Page 7]
Companions, by some trifling Largesses, which my Stock enabled me to bestow, as occasion required; but I must inform you, that after sixteen Years of Idleness at Home, I had but little Heart to my Nouns and Pronouns, which now began to be crammed upon me; and being the eldest Lad in the House, I sometimes regretted the Loss of the Time past, and at other times despaired of ever making a Scholar, at my Years; and was ashamed to stand like a great Lubber, declining of Hæc Mulier, a Woman, whilst my School-fellows, and Juniors by five Years, were engaged in the Love Stories of Ovid, or the luscious Songs of Horace: I own these Thoughts almost overcame me, and threw me into a deep melancholly, of which I soon after by Letter informed my Mother; who, (by the Advice as I suppose of my Friend, by this Time her Suitor) sent me Word to mind my Studies, and I should want for nothing. 

[Page 8]

CHAP. II. 

How he spent his Time at the Academy; an Intrigue with a Servant-Maid there; she declares herself with Child by him; her Expostulations to him; he is put to it for Money; refused it from Home, by his Friend, who had married his Mother; is drawn in to marry the Maid; she lies-in at her Aunt's; returns to her Service; he has another Child by her. 
I had now been passing my Time for about three Months, in this melancholy Way; and you may imagine, under that Disadvantage, had made but little Progress in my Learning; when one of our Maids, taking Notice one Day of my Uneasiness, as I sat musing in my Chamber, according to my Custom, began to rally me, that I was certainly in Love, I was so sad. Indeed, I never had a Thought of Love before; but the good-natur'd Girl, seeming to pity me, and seriously asking me the Cause, I fairly open'd my Heart to her; and for fear my Master should know it, gave her half a Crown to be silent. This last Engagement fixed her my Devotee, and from that Time, we had frequent Conferences, in Confidence together; till at length, Inclination, framed by Opportunity, produced the Date of a World of Concern to me; for, about six Months after my Arrival at the Academy, instead of proving my Parts by my Scholarship, I 
[Page 9]
had proved my Manhood, by being the destined Father of an Infant, which my female Correspondent then assured me would soon be my own. 
We nevertheless held on our frequent Intercourse; nor was I so alarmed at the News, as I ought to have been, till about two Months after, when Patty (for that was the only Name I then knew her by) explained herself to me, in the following Terms. -You know, Mr. Peter, how Matters are with me; I should be very sorry, for your Sake, and my own too, to reveal my Shame; but in spite of us both, Nature will shew itself; and truly, I think, some care should be taken, and some Method proposed, to preserve the Infant, and avoid, as far as may be, the Inconveniencies that may attend us; for, here is now no room for Delay. -This Speech, I own, gave me the first Reflection I ever had in my Life, and lock'd up all my Faculties for a long Time; nor was I able, for the Variety of Ideas that crowded my Brain, to make a Word of Answer, but stood like an Image of Stone; till Patty, seeing my Confusion, desired me to recollect my Reason, for as it was too late to undo what had been done, it remained now only to act with that Prudence, and Caution, which the Nature of the Case required; and that, for her Part, she would concur in every reasonable Measure I should approve of; but, I must remember, she was only a Servant, and had very little due to her for Wages, and not a Penny besides that; and, 
[Page 10]
that there must necessarily be a Preparation made for the Reception of the Infant, when Time should produce it. -I now began to see the absolute Necessity of all she said; but, how to accomplish it, was not in me to comprehend. - My own small Matter of Money was gone, and had been so a long Time; we therefore agreed, I should write to my Mother for a fresh Supply; I did so, and, to my great Confusion, was answered by my former Friend, in the following Words. 

Son Peter, 
Your Mother and I are much surprised you should write for Money, having so amply provided for you; but as it is not many Months to Christmas, when possibly we may send for you home, you must make yourself easy till then; as a School-boy, with all Necessaries found him, can't have much occasion for Money. 
Your loving Father, J. G. 
Imagine, if it is possible, my Consternation at the Receipt of this Letter. I began to think, I should be tricked out of what my Father and Grandfather had, with so much Pains and Industry, for many Years been heaping up for me; and had a thousand Thoughts altogether, justling out each other; so could resolve on nothing. I then shewed Patty the Letter, and we both condoled my hard Fortune, but saw no Remedy. Time wore away, and nothing done, or like to be, as I could see. -For my Part, I was like one distracted, and no more able to assist, or counsel 
[Page 11]
what should be done, than a Child in Arms. At length poor Patty, who had sat thinking some Time, began, with telling me, she had formed a Scheme, which in some Measure might help us; but, fearing it might be disagreeable to me, she durst not mention it, till I should assure her, whatever I thought of That, I would think no worse of her, for proposing it. -This preparatory Introduction, startled me a great deal; for it darted into my Head, she waited for my Concurrence to destroy the Child; to which, I could never have consented. But, upon my assuring her, that I would not think the worse of her, for whatever she should propose, but freely give her my Opinion upon it; she told me, as she could see no other Way before us, but what tended to our Disgrace and Ruin, if I would marry her, she would immediately quit her Place, and retire to her Aunt, who had brought her up from a Child, and had enough, prettily to live upon; who, she did not doubt, would entertain her as my Wife, but she was assured, upon any other Score, or under any other Name, would prove her most inveterate Enemy. -When Patty had made an end, I was glad to find it no worse, and revolving Matters a little in my Mind, both as to Affairs at home, and the requested Marriage, I concluded upon this latter, and had a great Inclination to acquaint my Mother of it; but was diverted from that, by suspecting it might prove a good Handle for my new Father, to work with my Mother some 
[Page 12]
Mischief against me; so determined to marry forthwith, send Patty to her Aunt's, and remain still at the Academy myself, till I should see what turn Things would take at home. Accordingly, the next Day, good Part of Patty's Wages went to tie the Connubial Knot, and to the honest Parson for a Bribe to ante-date the Certificate; and she very soon after took up the rest, to defray her Journey to her Aunt's. 
Though Patty was within two Months of her Time, she had so managed, that no one perceived it; and, getting safe to her Aunt's, was delivered of a Daughter, of which she wrote me Word, and said, she hoped to see me at the End of her Month. How, think I, can she expect to see me, Money I have none; and then, I despaired of Leave for a Journey, if I had it; and to go without Leave, would only arm J. G. against me, as I perceived plainly his Interest and mine were very remote Things; so I resolved to quit all Thoughts of a Journey, and wait till Opportunity better served, for seeing my Wife and Child, and our good Aunt, to whom we were so much obliged. -While these and such like Cogitations engrossed my whole Attention, I was most pleasingly surprised one Day, upon my return from a musing Walk, by the River Side, at the End of our Garden, where I frequently got my Tasks, to find Patty sitting in the Kitchen, with my old Mistress, my Master's Mother, who managed his House, 
[Page 13]
he having been a Widower many Years. The Sight of her almost overcame me, as I had bolted into the Kitchen, and was seen by my old Mistress, before I had seen Patty was with her. The old Lady perceiving me discomposed, inquired into the Cause, which I directly imputed to the Symptoms of an Ague, that, I told her, I had felt upon me best Part of the Morning. She, a good motherly Woman, feeling my Pulse, and satisfying herself of its Disorder, immediately ran to her Closet to bring me a Cordial, which she assured me had done Wonders in the like Cases; so that I had but just Time to embrace Patty, and enquire after our Aunt and Daughter, before Madam returned with the Cordial. Having drank it, and given Thanks, I was going to withdraw, but she would not part with me so; for nothing less than my Knowledge, that this Cordial was of her own making, from whence she had the Receipt, and an exact Catalogue of the several Cures it had done, would serve her Turn; which, taking up full three Quarters of an Hour, gave room to Patty and me, to enjoy each others Glances for that Time, to our mutual Satisfaction. At last, the old Prattlebox having made a short Pause, to recover Breath, from the Narrative of the Cordial; Mr. Peter, says she, you look as if you did not know poor Patty; she has not left me so long that you should forget her; she is a good tight Wench, and I was sorry to part with her; but she is out of Place, she says, 
[Page 14]
and as that dirty Creature Nan is gone, I think to take her again. I told her, I well knew she was judge of a good Servant, and I did not doubt Patty was such, if she thought so; and then I made my Exit, lighter in Heart by a Pound than I came. 
I shall not tire you any farther with the Amours between self and Patty; but to let you know, she quitted her Place again, seven Months after, upon the same Score. 
CHAP. III. 

Minds his Studies; informs his Master of his Mother's Marriage, and Usage of him; hears of her Death; makes his Master his Guardian; goes with him to take Possession of his Estate; is informed all is given to his Father-in-Law; Moral Reflections on his Condition, and on his Father's Crimes. 
I was now near nineteen Years of Age; and though I had so much more in my Head, than my School-Learning, I know not how it happened, but ever since the Commencement of my Amour with Patty, having somebody to disburthen my Mind to, and participate in my Concerns, I had been much easier, and had kept true tally with my Book, with more than usual Delight; and being arrived to an Age, to 
[Page 15]
comprehend what I heard and read, I could, from the general Idea I had of Things, form a pretty regular Piece of Latin, without being able to repeat the very Rules it was done by; so that I had the Acknowledgment of my Master, for the best Capacity he ever had under his Tuition: This, he not sparing frequently to mention it before me, was the acutest Spur he could have applied to my Industry; and now, having his good Will, I began to disuse set Hours of Exercise, but at my Conveniency applied myself to my Studies, as I best pleased, being always sure to perform as much, or more, than he ever enjoined me, till I grew exceedingly in his Confidence, and by Reason of my Age (though I was but small, yet manly) I became rather his Companion upon Parties, than his direct Pupil. 
It was upon one of these Parties, I took the Opportunity to declare the Dissatisfaction I had at my Mother's second Marriage. Sir, says I, surely I was of Age to have known it first, especially, considering the Affection my Mother had always shewn to me, and my never once having done the least Thing to disoblige her; but, Sir, said I, something else I fear is intended, by my Mother's Silence to me; for I have never received above three Letters from her, since I came here, which is now you know, three Years; and those were within the first three Months. I then shewed him the forementioned Letter I received from my new Father-in-Law, and assured him, that gave me the first Hint of this second Marriage. 

[Page 16]
I found, by the Attention my Master gave to my relation, he seemed to suspect this Marriage would prove detrimental to me; but not, on the sudden, knowing what to say to it, he told me, he would consider of it; and, by all Means, advised me to write a very obliging Letter to my new Father, with my humble Request, that he would please to order me home the next Recess of our Learning. I did so, under my Master's Dictation; and not long after received an Answer to the following Effect. 

Son Peter, 
Your Mother has been dead a good while; and as to your Request, it will be only expensive, and of little Use; for a Person who must live by his Studies, can't apply to them too closely. 
This Letter, if I had a little hope left, quite subdued my Fortitude, and well nigh reduced me to Clay. However, with Tears in my Eyes, I shewed it to my Master; who, good Man, wishing me well; Peter, says he, what can this mean, here is some Mistery concealed in it; here is some ill Design on Foot; then, taking the Letter into his Hand, a Person who must live by his Studies, says he, here is more meant than we can think for. Why? Have not you a pretty Estate to live upon, when it comes to your Hands? Peter, says he, I would advise you to go to your Father, and inquire how your Affairs are left; but I am afraid to let you 
[Page 17]
go alone, and will, when my Students depart at Christmas, accompany you myself, with all my Heart; for, you must know, I have advised on your Affair already, and find, you are of Age to chuse yourself a Guardian, who may be any Relation, or Friend you can confide in; and may see you have Justice done you. I immediately thanked him for the Hint, and begged him to accept of the Trust, as my only Friend, having very few, if any near Relations; this, he with great Readiness complied with, and was admitted accordingly. 
So soon as our Scholars were gone home, my Master lending me a Horse, we set out together, to possess ourselves of all my Father's real Estate, and such Part of the Personal as he had been advised would belong to me. Well, we arrived at the old House, but were not received with such extraordinary Tokens of Friendship, as would give the least room to suppose we were welcome. For my Part, all I said, or could say, was, that I was very sorry for my Mother's Death. My Father replied, so was he. Here we paused, and might have sat silent till this Time for she, if my Master, a grave Man, who had seen the World, and was unwilling any Part of our Time there, which he guessed would be short, should be lost, had not broke Silence. Mr. G. says he, I see the Loss of Master Wilkins's Mother puts him under some Confusion; so that you will excuse me, as his Preceptor, 
[Page 18]
and Friend, in making some Inquiry, how his Affairs stand, and how his Effects are disposed; as I don't doubt, you have taken care to schedule every Thing that will be coming to him; and though he is not yet of the necessary Age, for taking upon himself the Management of his Estate, he is nevertheless of Capacity to understand the Nature, and Quantum of it, and, to shew his Approbation of the Disposition of it, as if he was a Year or two older. -During this Discourse, Mr. G. turned pale, then reddened, was going to interrupt, then checked himself; but however, kept Silence, till my Master had done; when, with a Sneer, he replied, Sir, I must own myself a great Stranger to your Discourse; nor can I, for my Life, imagine, what your Harangue tends to; but sure I am, I know of no Estate, real, or personal, or any thing else belonging to young Mr. Wilkins, to make a Schedule of, as you call it: But this I know, his Mother had an Estate in Land, near two hundred a Year, and also a good Sum of Money, when I married her; but the Estate, the settled on me before her Marriage, to dispose of after her Decease, as I saw fit; and her Money and Goods are all come to my sole Use, as her Husband. -I was just ready to drop, while Mr. G. gave this Relation, and was not able to reply a Word; but my Master, though sufficiently shocked at what he had heard, replied; Sir, I am informed the Estate, and also 
[Page 19]
the Money you mention, was Mr. Wilkins's Father's at his Death; and I am surprized to think any one should have a better Title to them; than my Pupil, his only Child. Sir, says Mr. G, you are deceived, and tho' what you say seems plausible enough, and is in some Part true, as that the late Mr. Wilkins had such Estate, and some hundreds, I may say thousands, at his Death, yet you seem ignorant that he made a Deed just before entring into the fatal Rebellion, by which he gave my late Wife both the Estate, Money, and every thing else he had, absolutely, without any Conditions whatsoever; all which, on his unhappy Execution, she enjoyed, and now of Right, as I told you before, belongs to me; however, as I have no Child, if Peter behaves well under your Direction, I have Thoughts of paying another Year's Board for him, and then he must shift for himself. 
Oh! cried I, for the Mercy of some savage Beast to devour me! Is this what I have been cocker'd up for! Why was I not placed out to some laborious Craft, where I might have drudged for Bread in my proper Station! But, I fear, it is too late to inquire into what is past, and must submit. 
My Master (good Man) was thunderstruck at what he had heard; and finding our Business done there, we took our Leaves, after Mr. G. had again repeated, that if I behaved well, my Preceptor should keep me another Year; which was all I must expect from him; and at my Departure 
[Page 20]
he gave me a Crown Piece, which I then durst not refuse, for fear of offending my Master. 
We made the best of our Way Home again to my Tutor's, where I stayed but a Week, to consider what I should do with myself. In this Time he did all he could to comfort me, telling me, if I would stay with him and become his Usher, he would compleat my Learning for nothing, and allow me a Salary for my Trouble. But my Heart was too lofty to think of becoming an Usher, within so little a Way from mine own Estate in other Hands. However, since I had not a Penny of Money to endeavour at recovering my Right with, I told my Master I would consider of his Proposal. 
During my Stay with him, he used all Methods to make me as easy as possible; and frequently moralliz'd with so much Effect, that I was almost convinced I ought to submit, and be content. Amongst the rest of his Discourse, he endeavoured to shew me one Day, after I had been loudly condemning my cruel Fortune, and saying I was born to be unhappy, that I was mistaken, if I thought, or imagined, it was Chance or Accident that had been against me, when I complained of Fortune; for, says he, Peter, there is nothing done below, but is at least fore-known if not decreed above; and our Business in Life is to believe so: Not that I would have such Belief make us careless, and 
[Page 21]
think it to no Purpose to strive, as some do; who being persuaded that our Actions are not in our own Choice, but that, being pressed by an irresistable Decree, we are forced to act this or that, fancy we must be necessarily happy or miserable hereafter: Or, as others, who, for fear of falling upon that shocking Principle, would even deprive the Almighty of Fore-knowledge, lest it should consequentially amount to a Decree; for (say they) what is foreknown, will, and must be: But I would have you act so, as that, let either of these Tenets be true, you may still be sure of making yourself easy and happy: And for that Purpose let me recommend to you a uniform Life of Justice and Piety; always choosing the good rather than the bad Side of every Action; for this, say they what they will to the contrary, is not above the Power of a reasonable Being to practice; and doing so, you may without Scruple say, If there is Fore-knowledge of my Actions, or they are decreed, I then am one who is fore-known or decreed to be happy: And this, without further Speculation, you will find the only Means always to keep you so; for all Men, of all Denominations, fully allow this happy Effect to follow good Actions. Again, Peter, a Person acting in a vicious Course, with such an Opinion in his Head as above, must surely be very miserable, as his very Actions themselves must pronounce the Decree against him: Whilst therefore we have not heard the Decree read, 
[Page 22]
you see, we may easily give Sentence whether it be for Good or Evil to us, by the Tenour and Course of our own Actions. 
You are not now to learn, Peter, that the Crimes of the Father are often punished in the Children, often in the Father himself, sometimes in both, and not seldom in neither, in this Life; and tho', at first, one should think the future Punishment, annexed to bad Actions, was sufficient, still it is necessary some should suffer here also for an Example to others; we being much more affected with what the Eye sees, than what the Heart only meditates upon. 
Now, to bring it to our own Case; your Father, Peter, rose against the lawful Magistrate, to deprive him (it matters not that he was a bad one) of his lawful Power. Your Father's Policy was such, and his Design so well laid, as he thought, that upon any ill Success to himself, he had secured his Estate to go in the Way of all others he could wish to have it, and sits down very well contented, that, happen what would, he should bite the Government, in preventing the Forfeiture. But lo his Policy is as a Wall of Sand blown down with a Puff, for it is to you it ought, even himself being Umpire, to have come, as no one, would think, he could prize any before you his own Child. Now, could he look from the Grave, and know what passes here, and see Mr. G. in Possession of all he fancied he had secured for you, what a weak and short-sighted 
[Page 23]
Creature would he find himself. If it be said, he did not know he should have a Child, then herein appears God's Policy beyond Man's; for he knew it, and has so ordered, that that Child should be disinherited; for, by the way, Peter, take this for a Maxim, wherever the first Principle of an Action is ill, no good Consequence can possibly ever be an Attendant on it. Could he, as I said before, but look up and see you, his only Child, undone, by the very Instrument he designed for your Security, how pungent would be his Anxiety. I say, Peter, tho' there is something so unaccountable, to human Wisdom, in such Events of Things, yet there is something therein so reasonable, and just withal, that by a prying Eye, the Supreme Hand may very visibly be seen in them. Now this being plainly the Case before us, and herein the Glory of the Almighty exalted, rest content under it, and let not this Disappointment, befallen you for your Father's Faults, be attended with others sent down for your own; but remember this, the Hand that depresses a Man, is no less able to exalt and establish him.

CHAP. IV. 

Departs secretly from his Master; travels to Bristol; religious Thoughts by the Way; enters on Shipboard, and is made Captain's Steward. 
I seemed to be very well satisfied whilst my Master was speaking; but tho' I thought he talked like an Angel, my former Uneasiness seized me at parting with him. In short, without more Consideration, I rose in the Morning early and marched off; having first wrote to my Wife, at her Aunt's, relating the State of the Case to her, with my Resolution to leave England, the first Opportunity; giving her what Comfort I could, assuring her, if I ever was a Gainer in Life, she should not fail to be a Partaker, and promising also to let her know where I settled. I walked at a great Rate, for fear my Master's Kindness should prompt him to send after me; and taking the By-ways, I reached by dark Night a little Village, where I resolved to halt. Upon Inquiry, I found myself Thirty-five Miles from my Master's. -I had eaten nothing all Day, and was very hungry and weary, but my Crown Piece was as yet whole; however, I fed very sparingly, being over-pressed with the Distress of my Affairs and the Confusion of my Thoughts. -I slept that Night tolerably; but the Morning brought its Face of Horror with it. I had inquired over Night where I was, and been informed that I 
[Page 25]
was not above sixteen Miles from Bristol, for which Place I then resolved. -At my setting out in the Morning, after I had walked about three Miles, and had recollected a little my Master's last Discourse, I found by Degrees my Spirit grew calmer, than it had been since I left Mr. G. at my House, (as I shall ever call it;) and looking into myself for the Cause, found another Set of Thoughts were preparing a Passage into my Mind, which did not carry half the Dread and Terror with them that their Predecessors had; for I began to cast aside the Difficulties and Apprehensions I before felt in my Way, and, encouraging the present Motions, soon became sensible of the Benefit of a virtuous Education; and though what I had hitherto done in the immediate Service of God, I must own, had been performed from Force, Custom, and Habit, and without the least Attention to the Object of the Duty; yet, as under my Mother at Home, and my Master at the Academy, I had been always used to say my Prayers, as they called it, Morning and Night; I began with a Sort of superstitious Reflection, to accuse myself of having omitted that Duty the Night before, and also, at my setting out in the Morning, and very much to blame myself for it; and at the same Instant, even wondred at myself for that Blame. - What, says I, is the real Use of this praying? and to whom or to what do we pray? I see no one to pray to, neither have I ever thought that my Prayers would be answered. 'Tis true, they are worded as 
[Page 26]
if we prayed to God: but he is in Heaven, does he concern himself with us, who can do him no Service? Can I think all my Prayers that I have said, from Day to Day, so many Years, have been heard by him? No sure; if they had, I should scarce have sustained this hard Fate in my Fortune. But hold, how have I prayed to him? Have I as earnestly prayed to him, as I used to petition my Mother for any thing when I wanted it against her Inclination? No, I can't say I have. And would my Mother have granted me such Things, if she had not thought, I from my Heart desired them, when I used to be so earnest with her? No surely, I can't say she had any Reason for it. But I had her indeed before me; now I have not God in my View, he is in Heaven: Yet, let me see, my Master, and I can't help thinking he must know, used to say, that God is a Spirit, and not confined by the Incumbrance of a Body, as we are; now, if it is so, why may not he virtually be present with me, though I don't perceive him? Why may he not be at once in Heaven, and elsewhere? For, if he consists not of Parts, nothing can circumscribe him. And truly, I believe it must be so; for if he is of that supreme Power as he is represented, he could never act in so unconfined a Capacity, under the Restraint of Place; but if he is an operative and purely spiritual Being, then I can see no Reason, why his virtual 
[Page 27]
Essence should not be diffused through all Nature; and then, which I begin to think most likely, why should not I suppose him ever present with me, and able to hear me? And why should not I, when I pray, have a full Idea of the Being, tho' not of any corporeal Parts or Form, of God; and so have actually somewhat to be intent upon in my Prayers? and not do as I have hitherto done, say so many Words only upon my Knees; which I can't help thinking, may be as well without either Sense or Meaning in themselves, as without a proper Object in my Mind to direct them unto. 
These Thoughts agitated me at least two Miles, working stronger and stronger in me; till at length, bursting into Tears, Have I been doing nothing, says I, in the Sight of God, under the Name of Prayers, for so many Years? Yes, it is certainly so. Well, by the Grace of God, it shall be so no longer, I'll try somewhat more. So looking round about me, to see if I was was quite alone, I slept into an adjoining Copse, and could scarce refrain falling on my Knees, till I came to a proper Place for kneeling in. I then poured forth my whole Soul and Spirit to God; and all my Strength, and every Member, every Faculty, was to the utmost employed, for a considerable Time, in that most agreeable as well as useful Duty. I would indeed have began with my accustomed Prayers, and 
[Page 28]
had repeated some Words of them; when, as though against and contrary to my Design, I was carried away by such rapturous Effusions, that, to this Hour, when I reflect thereon, I can't believe, but I was moved to them by a much more than human Impulse. However, this Extasy did not last above a Quarter of an Hour; but it was considerably longer before my Spirits subsided to their usual Frame. -When I had a little composed myself, how was I altered, how did I condemn myself for all my past Disquiet; what calm Thanks did I return for the Ease and Satisfaction of Mind I then enjoyed; and coming to a small Rivulet, I drank an hearty Draught of Water, and contentedly proceeding on my Journey, I reached Bristol about four a Clock in the Afternoon. Having refreshed myself, I went the same Evening to the Kay, to inquire what Ships were in the River, whither bound, and when they would depart. My Business was with the Sailors, of whom there were at that Time great Numbers there; but I could meet with no Employ, though I gave out, I would gladly enter myself before the Mast. -After I had done the best I could, but without Success, I returned to the little House I had dined at, and went to Bed very pensive. I did not forget my Prayers; but I could by no Means be roused to such Devotion as I felt in the Morning. Next Day I walked again to the 
[Page 29]
Kay, asking all I met, who looked like Sea-faring Men, for Employment; but could hear of none, there being many waiting for Births; and I feared, my Appearance (which was not so mean, as most of that Sort of Gentry's is) would prove no small Disappointment to my Preferment that Way. At last, being out of Heart with my frequent Repulses, I went to a landing Place just by, and as I asked some Sailors who were putting two Gentlemen on Shore, if they wanted a Hand on board their Ship, one of the Gentlemen, whom I afterwards found to be the Master of a Vessel bound to the Coast of Africa, turned back, and looking earnestly on me, young Man, says he, do you want Employment on board? I immediately made him a Bow, and answered, yes, Sir. Said he, there is no talking in this Weather, for it then blew almost a Storm, but step into that Tavern, pointing to the Place, and I'll be with you presently. -I went thither, and not long after came my future Master. He asked me many Questions, but the first was, Whether I had been at Sea? I told him no; but I did not doubt soon to learn the Duty of a Sailor. He then looked on my Hand, and, shaking his Head, told me it would not do, for I had too soft a Hand. I told him I was determined for the Sea, and that my Hand and Heart should go together; and I hoped my Hand would soon harden, though not my Heart. 
[Page 30]
He then told me, it was pity to take such a pretty young Fellow before the Mast; but if I understood Accounts tolerably, and could write a good Hand, he would make me his Steward, and make it worth my while. I answered in the affirmative, joyfully accepting his Offer; but on his asking me where my Chest was, (for, says he, if the Wind had not been so strong against me, I had fallen down the River this Morning) I looked very blank, and plainly told him I had no other Stores than I carried on my Back. The Captain smiled. Says he, young Man, I see you are a Novice; why, the meanest Sailor in my Ship has a Chest, at least, and perhaps something in it; come, says he, my Lad, I like your Looks, be diligent and honest, I'll let you have a little Money to set you out, and deduct it in your Pay. He was then pulling out his Purse, when I begged him, as he seemed to shew me so great a Kindness, that he would order somebody to buy what Necessaries he knew I should want, for me, or I should be under as great a Difficulty to know what to get, and where to buy them, as I should have been at for want of them. He commended my Prudence, and said he would buy them and send them on board himself; so bid me trouble myself no more about them, but go to the Ship, in the return of his Boat, and stay there till he came; giving me a Ticket to the Boat's Crew to take me in. When 
[Page 31]
I came to the Shore, the Boat was gone off, and at a good Distance; but I hailed them, and shewing my Ticket, they put back, and took me safe to the Ship; heartily glad that I was entred upon my new Service. 
CHAP. V. 

His first Entertainment on board; sets sail; his Sickness; Engagement with a French Privateer; is taken and laid in Irons. Twenty-one Prisoners turned adrift in a small Boat with only two Days Provision. 
Being once on board, and in Pay, I thought I was a Man for myself; and set about considering how to behave; and no body knowing, as yet, upon what footing I came on board, they took me for a Passenger, as my Dress did not at all bespeak me a Sailor; so every one, as I sauntered about, had something to say to me. By and by comes a pert young Fellow up, Sir, says he, your Servant; what, I see, our Captain has picked up a Passenger at last. Passenger, says I, you are pleased to be merry Sir, I am no Passenger. Why, pray, says he, what may you be then? Sir, says I, the Captain's Steward. You impertinent Puppy, says he, what an Answer you give me; you the Captain's Steward; No, Sir, that Place, 
[Page 32]
I can assure you, is in better Hands, and away he turned. -I knew not what to think of it, but was terribly afraid I should draw myself into some Scrape. By and by, others asked me, some one thing, some another, and I was very cautious what Answers I made them, for fear of Offence; till a gravish Sailor came and sat down by me, and, after talking of the Weather, and other indifferent Matters, pray, says I, Sir, who is that Gentleman that was so affronted at me soon after I came on board? Oh, says he, a proud insignificant Fellow, the Captain's Steward; but don't mind him, says he, he uses the Captain himself as bad; they have had high Words just before the Captain went on Shore; and had he used me, as he did him, I should have made no Ceremony of tipping him over-board, a Rascal. Says I, you surprize me, for the Captain sent me on board to be his Steward, and agreed with me about it this Afternoon. Hush, says he, I see how it will go; the Captain, if that's the Case, will discharge him when he comes on board; and indeed, I believe, he would not have kept him so long, but we have waited for a Wind, and he could not provide himself. 
The Captain came on board at Night; and the first thing he did, was to demand the Keys of Mr. Steward, which he gave to me, and ordered him on Shore. 

[Page 33]
The next Morning the Captain went on Shore himself; but the Wind chopping about, and standing fair about Noon, he returned then with my Chest, and before Night we were got into sailing Order, and before the Wind, with a brisk Gale. 
What happened the first fourteen Days of our Passage I know not, having been all that Time so sick and weak, I could scarcely keep Life and Soul together; but after grew better and better. We prosecuted our Voyage, touching, for about a Week, at the Madeiras in our Way. The Captain grew very fond of me, and never put me to hard Duty, and I passed my Time (under his Favour) very pleasantly. One Evening, being within sixty Leagues of the Cape of Palmes, calm Weather, but the little Wind we had against us, one of our Men spied a Sail, and gave the Captain notice of it. He not suspecting Danger, minded it little; and we made what Way the Wind would permit; but, Night coming on, and the calm continuing, about peep of Day, we perceived we were infallibly fallen in with a French Privateer; who, hoisting French Colours, called out to us to strike. Our Captain had scarce Time to consider what to do, they were so near us; but as he had twenty-two Men on board, and eight Guns, he could bring to; so he called all Hands on Deck, and telling them the Consequence of a Surrender, asked them if they would 
[Page 34]
stand by him. One and all swore, they would fight the Ship to the Bottom, rather than fall into the Privateer's Hands. -The Captain immediately gave the Word for a clear Deck, prepared his Firearms, and begged them to be active and obey Orders; and perceiving the Privateer out numbered our Hands by abundance, he commanded all the small Arms to be brought upon Deck loaded, and to run out as many of the Ship's Guns as she could bring to on one Side; and to charge them all with small Shot; then stand to till he gave Directions. - The Privateer being a light Ship, and a small Breeze arising, run up close to us; first firing one Gun, then another, still calling out to us to strike; but we neither returned Fire or Answer, till he came almost within Pistol shot of us, and seeing us a small Vessel, thought to board us directly; but then our Captain ordered a broad Side, and immediately all Hands to come on Deck; himself standing there at the Time of our first Fire with his Fusee in his Hand, and near him I stood with another. We killed eight Men and wounded several others. The Privateer then fired a broad Side through and through us. By this Time our Hands were all on Deck, and the Privateer pushing in hopes to grapple and board us, we gave them a Volley from thence, that did good Execution; and then all Hands to the Ship's Guns again, except four, 
[Page 35]
who were left along with me to charge the small Arms. It is incredible how soon they had fired the great Guns, and were on Deck again. This last Fire, being with Ball, raked the Privateer miserably. Then we fired the small Arms, and away to the Ship's Guns. This we did three Times successively without Loss of a Man; and I believe if we could have held it once more, and no Assistance had come to the Privateer, she had sheered quite off: But our Captain spying a Sail at some Distance behind the Privateer, who lay to Windward of us, and seeing by his Glass it was a Frenchman, was almost dismayed; the same Sight put Courage into our Enemies, who thereupon redoubled the Attack; and, the first Volley of their small Arms, shot our Captain in the Breast, upon which he dropped dead without stirring. I need not say, that Sight shocked me exceedingly. Indeed, it disconcerted the whole Action; and though our Mate, a Man of good Courage and Experience, did all that a brave Man could do to animate the Men, they apparently drooped, and the Loss of the Ship became inevitable; so we struck, and the Frenchman boarded us. 
During the latter Part of the Engagement, we had two Men killed, and five wounded, who died afterwards of their Wounds. We, who were alive, were all ordered on board the Frenchman, 
[Page 36]
who, after rifling us, chained us two and two, and turned us into the Hold. Our Vessel was then ransacked; and the other Privateer, who had suffered much the Day before, in an Engagement with an English twenty-gun Ship of War, coming up, the Prize was sent by her into Port, where she herself was to refit. 
In this Condition did I, and fourteen of our Crew, lie for six Weeks; till the Fetters on our Legs had almost eaten to the Bone, and the Stench of the Place had well nigh suffocated us. 
The Glorieux, for that was the Name of the Privateer who took us, saw nothing further in five Weeks worth her Notice, which very much discouraged the Men; and consulting together, it was agreed, to cruise more Northward, between Sierra Leon and Cape de Verd; but, about Noon, next Day, they spied a Sale, coming West North West, with a fresh Gale. The Captain thereupon ordered all to be ready, and lie by for her. But, though she discerned us, she kept her Way, bearing only more Southward; when the Wind shifting to North-East, she ran for it, full before the Wind, and we after her with all the sail we could crowd; and though she was a very good Sailer, we gained upon her, being laden, and before Night, came pretty well up with her; but, being a large Ship, and the 
[Page 37]
Evening haizy, we did not chuse to engage her till Morning. The next Morning we found she was slunk away; but we fetched her up, and, hoisting French Colours, fired a Shot; which she not answering, our Captain run along Side of her, and fired a broad Side; then slackening upon her, a hard Engagement ensued; the Shot thumping so against our Ship, that we Prisoners, who had nothing to do in the Action, expected Death, one or other of us, every Moment. The Merchant Man was so heavy loaded, and drew so much Water, that she was very unweildy in Action; so after a Fight of two Hours, when most of her Rigging and Masts were cut, and wounded, she struck. Twelve Men were sent on Board her, and her Captain and several Officers were ordered on Board us. 
Their were thirty-eight Persons in her, including Passengers: all of whom, except five, and the like Number which had been killed in the Action, were sent chained into the Hold to us, who had lain there almost six Weeks. This Prize put Monsieur into good Heart, and determined him to return Home with her. But in two Days Time, his new Acquisition was found to have leaked so fast near the Bottom, that before they were aware of it, the Water was risen some Feet. Several Hands were employed 
[Page 38]
to find out the Leak; but all asserted it was too low to be come at; and as the Pumps, with all the Labour the Prisoners, who were the Persons put to it, could use, would not reduce it, but it still increased, they removed what Goods they could into the Privateer; and before they could unload it, the Prize sunk. 
The next Thing they consulted upon, was, what to do with the Prisoners, who, by the Loss of the Prize, were now grown too numerous to be trusted in the Privateer; fearing too, as they were now so far out at Sea, by the great Addition of Mouths, they might soon be brought to short Allowance; it was (on both Accounts) resolved, to give us the Prize's Boat, which they had saved, and turn us adrift to shift for ourselves. There were in all forty-three of us; but the Privateer having lost several of their own Men in the two Engagements, they looked us over, and picking out two and twenty of us, who were the most likely Fellows for their Purpose, the remaining one and twenty were committed to the Boat, with about two Days Provision and a small Matter of Ammunition, and turned out. 

[Page 39]

CHAP. VI. 

The Boat, two hundred Leagues from Land, makes no Way, but drives more to Sea by the Wind; the People live nine Days at quarter Allowance; four die with Hunger the twelfth Day; five more the fourteenth Day; on the fifteenth they eat one just dead; want of Water excessive; spy a Sail; are taken up; work their Passage to the African Shore; are sent on a secret Expedition; are Way-laid, taken Slaves, and sent up the Country. 
When we, who were in the Boat, came to reflect on our Condition, the Prospect before us appeared very melancholy; tho' we had at first readily enough embraced the Offer, rather than perish in so much Misery, as we suffered in our loathsome Confinement. We now judged we were above two hundred Leagues from Land, in about eight Degrees North Latitude; and blowing North-East, a pretty stiff Gale, we could make no Way, but rather lost, for we aimed at some Port in Africa, having neither Sail, Compass, or any other Instrument to direct us; so that all the Observation we could make was by the Sun for running Southward, or as the Wind carried us, for we had lost the North Pole. -As we had little above two Days Provisions, we perceived a 
[Page 40]
Necessity of almost starving, voluntarily, to avoid doing it quite; seeing it must be many Days before we could reach shore, if ever we did, having visibly driven a great deal more Southward than we were; nay, unless a sudden Change happened, we were sure of perishing, unless delivered by some Ship that Providence might send in our Way. - In short, the ninth Day came, but no Relief with it; and though we had lived at quarter Allowance, and but just saved Life, our Food, except a little Water, was all gone, and this caused us quite to despair. -On the twelfth Day four of our Company died with hunger, in a very miserable Way; and yet the Survivors had not Strength left to move them to pity their Fellows. In truth we had sat still, attempting nothing in several Days; as we found that unless the Wind shifted, we only consumed the little Strength we had left, to no Manner of Purpose. -On the fourteenth day, and in the Night, five more died, and a sixth was near expiring; and yet, we, the Survivors, were so indolent, we would scarce lend a Hand to throw them over-board. -On the fifteenth day in the morning, our Carpenter, weak as he was, started up, and as the sixth Man was just dead, cut his Throat, and, whilst warm, would let out what Blood would flow; then, pulling off his old Jacket, invited us to Dinner, and cutting a large Slice-off the Corpse, devoured it with as 
[Page 41]
much seeming Relish, as if it had been Ox Beef. His Example prevailed with the rest of us, one after another, to taste and eat; and as there had been a heavy Dew or Rain in the Night, and we had spread out very Thing we had of Linnen and Woolen to receive it, we were a little refreshed by wringing our Cloaths, and sipping what came from them; after which we covered them up from the Sun, stowing them all close together to keep in the Moisture, which served us to suck at for two Days after, a little and a little at a Time; for now we were in greater Distress for Water, than for Meat. -It has surprised me many Times since, to think how we could make so light a Thing of eating our Fellow Creature just dead before our Eyes; but, I'll assure you, when we had once tasted, we looked on the Blessing to be so great, that we cut and eat, with as little Remorse, as we should have had for feeding on the best Meat in an English Market: And most certainly, when this Corpse had failed, if another had not dropped by fair Means, we should have used foul, by murdering one of our Number as a Supply for the rest. 
Water, as I said before, to moisten our Mouths, was now our greatest Hardship, for every Man had so often drank his own, that we voided scarce any Thing but Blood, and that but a few Drops at a Time; our Mouths and Tongues were quite flead with Drought, and our Teeth just 
[Page 42]
falling from our Jaws; for, tho' we had tryed, by placing all the dead Men's Jackets and Shirts one over another, to strain some of the Sea-Water through 'em by small Quantities, yet that would not deprive it of its pernicious Qualities; and tho' it refreshed a little in going down, we were so sick, and strained ourselves so much after it, that it came up again, and made us more miserable than before. -Our Corpse now stunk so, what was left of it, that we could no longer bear it on Board, and every Man began to look with an evil Eye on his Fellow, to think whose Turn it would be next; for the Carpenter had started the Question, and preached us into the Necessity of it; and we had agreed, the next Morning, to put it to the Lot who should be the Sacrifice. -In this Distress of Thought, it was so ordered, by good Providence, that, on the 21st Day, we thought we spied a Sail coming from the North-west, which caused us to delay our Lots, till we should see whether it would discover us or not; we hung up some Jackets upon our Oars to be seen as far off as we could, but had so little Strength left, we could make no Way towards it; however, it happened to direct its Course so much to our Relief, that, an Hour before Sunset, it was within a League of us, but seemed to bear away more Eastward, and our Fear was, that they should not know our Distress, for we were not able to make any Noise from our 
[Page 43]
Throats, that might be heard fifty Yards; but the Carpenter, who was still the best Man amongst us, with much ado, getting one of the Guns to go off, in less than half an Hour she came up with us, and, seeing our deplorable Condition, took us all on Board, to the Number of eleven. Tho' no Methods were unessayed for our Recovery, four more of us died in as many Days. When the remaining seven of us came a little to ourselves, we found our Deliverers were Portuguese, bound for Saint Salvadore. We told the Captain, we begged he would let us work our Passage with him, be it where it would, to Shore; and then, if we could be of no further Service to him, we did not doubt getting into Europe again: But, in the Voyage, as we did him all the Service in our Power, we pleased him so well, that he engaged us to stay with him, to work the Ship home again, he having lost some Hands by Fevers soon after his setting Sail. 
We arrived safe in Port; and, in a few Days, the Captain, who had a secret Enterprize to take in hand, hired a Country coasting Vessel, and sent her seventeen Leagues further on the Coast for Orders from some Factory or Settlement there. I was one of the nine Men who were destined to conduct her; but, not understanding Portuguese, I knew little of the Business we went upon. We were to coast it all the Way, 
[Page 44]
but, on the tenth Day, just at Sun-rise, we fell in with a Fleet of Boats, which had way-laid us, and were taken Prisoners. Being carried ashore, we were conducted a long Way up the Country, where we were imprisoned, and almost starved: Tho' I never knew the Meaning of it; nor did any of us, unless the Mate, who, we heard, was carried up the Country, much further, to Angola; but we never heard more of him, tho' we were told he would be sent back to us. 
Here we remained under Confinement almost three Months, at the End of which Time our Keeper told us we were to be removed; and coupling us two and two together, sent a Guard with us to Angola; when, crossing a large River, we were set to Work in removing the Rubbish and Stones of a Castle, or Fortress, which had been lately demolished by an Earthquake and Lightning. Here we continued about five Months, being very sparingly dieted, and locked up every Night. 
This Place however I thought a Paradise to our former Dungeon; and as we were not over-worked, we made our Lives comfortable enough, having the Air all Day to refresh us from the Heat, and not wanting for Company: For there were, at least, three hundred of us about the whole Work; and I often fancied myself at the Tower of Babel, each Labourer, almost, speaking in a Language of his own. 

[Page 45]
Towards the latter End of our Work, our Keepers grew more and more remiss in their Care of us. At my first coming thither, I had contracted a Familiarity with one of the Natives, but of a different Kingdom, who was then a Slave with me; and he and I being able tolerably to understand each other, he hinted to me, one Day, the Desire he had of seeing his own Country and Family; who, neither knew whether he was dead or alive, or where he was, since he had left them, seven Years before, to make War in this Kingdom; and insinuated, that as he had taken a great Liking to me, if I would endeavour to escape with him, and we succeeded, he would provide for me; for, says he, you see, now our Work is almost over, we are but slightly guarded, and if we stay till this Job is once finished, we may be commanded to some new Works, at the other End of the Kingdom, for ought we know; so that our Labours will only cease with our Lives; and, for my part, immediate Death, in the Attempt of Liberty, is to me, preferable to a lingring Life of Slavery. 
These and such like Arguments prevailed on me to accompany him, as he had told me he had travelled most of the Country before, in the Wars of the different Nations; so, having taken our Resolution, the following Evening, soon after our Day's Work, and before the Time 
[Page 46]
came for locking up, we withdrew from the rest, but within hearing; thinking, if we should then be missed, and called, we would appear, and make some Excuse for our Absence, but if not, we should have the whole Night before us. 
When we were first put upon this Work, we were called over singly, by Name, Morning and Evening, to be let out and in, and were very narrowly observed in our Motions; but not one of us having been ever absent, our Actions were at length much less minded than before, and the Ceremony of calling us over was frequently omitted; so that we concluded, if we got away unobserved the first Night, we should be out of the Reach of Pursuers by the next; which was the soonest it was possible for them to overtake us, as we proposed to travel, the first Part of our Journey, with the utmost Dispatch. 

[Page 47]

CHAP. VII. 

The Author escapes with Glanlepze, a Native; their Hardships in Travel; plunder of a Cotage; his Fears; Adventure with a Crocodile; Passage of a River; Adventure with a Lioness and Whelp; arrive at Glanlepze's House; the Trial of Glanlepze's Wife's Constancy; the tender meeting of her and her Husband; the Author's Reflections thereupon. 
Having now set out with all possible Speed, we seemed to each other as joyful as we could; though it can't be supposed we had no Fears in our Minds, the first Part of our Journey, for we had many; but, as our Way advanced, our Fears subsided; and having, with scarce any Delay, pushed forwards for the first twenty-four Hours, Nature then began to have two very pressing Demands upon us, Food and Rest: But as one of them was absolutely out of our Power to comply with, she contented herself with the other, till we should be better able to supply her, and gave a further Time till the next Day. 
The next Morning found us very empty, and sharp set, tho' a very sound Night's Rest had contributed its utmost to refresh us. But what added much to our Discomfort was, that tho' our whole Subsistance must come from Fruits, 
[Page 48]
there was not a Tree to be found at a less Distance than twelve Leagues, in the open rocky Country we were then in; but a good Draught of excellent Water, we met with, did us extraordinary Service, and sent us with much better Courage to the Woods, tho' they were quite out of the Way of our Rout; there, by divers Kinds of Fruits, which, tho' my Companion knew very well, I was quite a Stranger to, we satisfied our Hunger for the present, and took a moderate Supply for another Opportunity. This retarded our Journey very much, for in so hard Travel every Pound weighed six before Night. 
I cant say this Journey, though bad enough, would have been so discouraging, but for the Trouble of fetching our Provisions so far; and then, if we meant not to loose half the next Day in the same Manner, we must double load ourselves, and delay our Progress by that Means; but we still went on, and in about eight Days got quite clear of Angola. 
On the eighth Day, my Companion, whose Name was Glanlepze, told me, we were very near the Confines of Congo, but there was one little Village still in Angola, by which we must pass, within half a League; and, if I would agree to it, he would go see what might be got here to supply ourselves with. I told him, I was in an unknown World, and would follow wherever he should lead me; but asked him 
[Page 49]
if he was not afraid of the People, as he was not of that Country; he told me, as there had been Wars between them and his Country, for assisting their Neighbours of Congo, he was not concerned for any Mischief he should do them, or they him; but, says he, you have a Knife in your Pocket, and with that we will cut two stout Clubs, and then follow me, fear nothing. 
We soon cut our Clubs, and marching on, in the Midst of some small Shrubs, and a few scattering Trees, we saw a little Hovel, larger, indeed, but worse contrived than an English Hogstie, to which we boldly advanced; and Glanlepze, entring first, saluted an old Man who was lying on a Parcel of Rushes. The Man attempted to run away, but Glanlepze stopped him, and we tyed his Hands and Feet. He then set up such a hideous Howl, that had not Glanlepze threatned to murder him, and prepared to do it, he would have raised the whole Village upon us; but we quieted him; and rumaging to find Provision, which was all we wanted, we, by good Luck, spied best Part of a Goat, hanging up behind a large Matt at the further End of the Room. By this Time in comes a Woman, with two Children very small. This was the old Man's Daughter, of about five and twenty. Glanlepze bound her also, and laid her by the old Man, but the two Children we suffered to lye untied. We then examined her, who told us, the old 
[Page 50]
Man was her Father, and that her Husband having killed a Goat that Morning, was gone to carry Part of it to his Sister; that they had little or no Corn; and finding we wanted Victuals, she told us, there was an earthen Pot we might boil some of the Goat in if we pleased. 
Having now seen all that was to be had, we were going to make up our Bundle, when a Muletto, very gently, put his Head into the Doorway; him, Glanlepze immediately seized; and bidding me fetch the great Mat, and the Goat's Flesh, he, in the mean Time, put a long Rope, he found there, about the Beast's Neck, and laying the Mat upon him, we packed up the Goat's Flesh, and a little Corn in a Calabash Shell; and then, turning up the Mat-round about, skewered it together, and over all we tyed the earthen Pot; Glanlepze crying out, at every Thing we loaded, it is no Hurt to plunder an Enemy; and so we marched off. 
I own, I had greater Apprehensions from this Adventure, than from any Thing before; for, says I, if the Woman's Husband returns soon, or if she, or her Father, can release themselves, they will raise the whole Village upon us, and we are undone: But Glanlepze laughed at me, saying, we had not an Hour's Walk out of the Angola Dominions; and that the King of Conga was at War with them, in helping the King of Loango, whose Subject himself was, and that the 
[Page 51]
Angolans durst not be seen out of their Bounds on that Side the Kingdom; for there was a much larger Village of Congovians in our Way, who would certainly rise and destroy them, if they came in any Numbers amongst them; and though, the War being carried on near the Sea, the Borders were quiet, yet, upon the least Stir, the whole Country would be in Arms, whilst we might retire thro' the Woods very safely. 
Well, we marched on, as fast as we could, all the Remainder of that Day, till Moon-light, close by the Skirt of a long Wood, that we might take Shelter therein, if there should be Occasion; and my Eyes were the best Part of the Way behind me; but, neither hearing or seeing any Thing to annoy us, and finding, by the Declivity of the Ground, we should soon be in some Plain, or Bottom, and have a Chance of Water for us all, and Pasture for our Muletto, who was now become one of us, we would not halt, till we found a Bottom to the Hill; which in half an Hour more we came to, and in some Minutes after to a Rivulet of fine clear Water, where we resolved to spend the Night. Here we fastned our Muletto by his Cord to a Stake in the Ground; but perceiving him not to have sufficient Range to fill his Belly in before Morning, we, under Glanlepze's Direction, cut several long Slips from the Mat, and soaking them well 
[Page 52]
in Water, twisted them into a very strong Cord, of sufficient Length for the Purpose. And now, having each of us brought a Bundle of dry fallen Sticks from the Wood with us, and gathered two or three Flints as we came along, we struck Fire on my Knife upon some rotten Wood, and boiled a good Piece of our Goat's Flesh; and having made such a Meal as we had neither of us made for many Months before, we laid us down and slept heartily till Morning. 
As soon as Day broke we packed up our Goods, and, filling our Calabash with Water, we loaded our Muletto, and got forward very pleasantly that Day, and several others following, and had tolerable Lodgings. 
About Noon, one Day, travelling with great Glee, we met an Adventure which very much daunted me, and had almost put a Stop to my Hopes of ever getting where I intended. We came to a great River, whose Name I have now forgot, near a League over, but full, and especially about the Shores, of large Trees which had fallen from the Mountains, and been rolled down with the Floods, and lodged there in a shocking Manner. This River Glanlepze told me we must pass. For my part, I shrunk at the Sight of it, and told him, if he could get over, I would not desire to prevent his meeting with his Family, but as for my Share, I had rather take my 
[Page 53]
Chance in the Woods, on this Side, than plunge myself into such a Stream, only for the Sake of Drowning. Oh! says Glanlepze, then you can't swim. No, says I, there's my Misfortune. Well, well, says the kind Glanlepze, be of good Heart, I'll have you over. He then bad me go cut an arm full of the tallest of the Reeds that grew there near the Shore, whilst he pulled up another, where he then was, and bring them to him. The Side of the River sloped for a good Way with an easy Descent, so that it was very shallow where the Reeds grew, and they stood very close together, upon a large Compass of Ground. I had no sooner entred the Reeds a few Yards, to cut some of the longest, but (being about Knee deep in the Water and Mud, and every Step raising my Feet very high, to keep them clear of the Roots, which were matted together) I thought, I had trod upon a Trunck of one of the Trees, of which, as I said, there was such Plenty thereabouts; and raising my other Foot, to get that also upon the Tree, as I fancied it, I found it move along with me; upon which, I roared out; when Glanlepze, who was not far from me, imagining what was the Matter, cried out, leap off, and run to shore to the Right. I knew not yet what was the Case, but did as I was bid, and gained the Shore. Looking back, I perceived the Reeds shake and 
[Page 54]
rustle all the Way to the Shore, by Degrees, after me. I was terribly frightened, and ran to Glanlepze, who then told me the Danger I had escaped, and that what I took for a Tree, was certainly a large Alligator, or Crocodile. 
My Blood ran chill within me, at hearing the Name of such a dangerous Creature; but he had no sooner told me what it was, than out came the most hideous Monster I had ever seen. Glanlepze ran to secure the Muletto; and then, taking the Cord which had fastened him, and tying it to each End of a broken Arm of a Tree that lay on the Shore, he marched up to the Crocodile without the least Dismay, and beginning near the Tail, with one Leg on one Side, and the other on the other Side, he straddled over him, still mending his Pace as the Beast crept forward, till he came to his Fore-Feet; then throwing the great Log before his Mouth, he by the Cord in his Hand, bobbed it against the Creature's Nose, till he gaped wide enough to have taken in the Muletto; then, of a sudden, jerking the Wood between his Jaws with all his Force, by the Cord, he gagged the Beast, with his Jaws wide open up to his Throat, so that he could neither make use of his Teeth, or shut his Mouth; he then threw one End of the Cord upon the Ground, just before the Creatures's under Jaw, which, as he by Degrees crept 
[Page 55]
along over it, came out behind his Fore-Legs, on the contrary Side; and serving the other End of it in the same Manner, he took up those Ends and tied them over the Creature's Back, just within his Fore-Legs, which kept the Gag firm in his Mouth; and then calling out to me, for I stood at a good Distance, Peter, saye he, bring me your Knife; I trembled at going so near for the Crocodile was turning his Head this Way and that very uneasy, and wanting to get to the River again, but yet I carried it, keeping as much behind him as I could, still eyeing him which Way he moved, and at length tossed my Knife so near, that Glanlepze could reach it; and he, just keeping behind the Beasts Fore-feet, and leaning forward, first darted the Knife into one Eye, and then into the other, and immediately leaping from his Back, came running to me. So Peter, says he, I have done the Business. Ay! Business enough, I think, says I, and more than I would have done, to have been King of Congo. Why Peter, says he, there is nothing but a Man may compass by Resolution, if he takes both Ends of a Thing in his View at once, and fairly deliberates on both Sides, what may be given and taken from End to End. What you have seen me perform, is only from a thorough Notion I have of this Beast, and of myself, how far each of us hath Power to 
[Page 56]
act and counter-act upon the other, and duly applying the Means. But, says he, this talk will not carry us cross the River; come, here are the Reeds I have pulled up, which I believe will be sufficient without any more, for I would not overload the Muletto. Why, says I, is the Muletto to carry them? No, they are to carry you, says he. I can never ride upon these says I. Hush, says he, I'll not loose you never fear. Come, cut me a good tough Stick, the Length of these Reeds. Well, says I, this is all Conjuration; but, I don't see a Step towards my getting over the River yet, unless I am to ride the Muletto upon these Reeds, and guide myself with the Stick. I must own, Peter, says he, you have a bright Guess. So, taking an Armful of the Reeds, and laying them on the Ground, now Peter, says he, lay that Stick upon those Reeds, and tie them tight at both Ends. I did so. Now Peter, says he, lay yourself down upon them. I then laying myself on my Back, lengthwise, upon the Reeds, Glanlepze laugh'd heartily at me, and turning me about, brought my Breast upon the Reeds at the Heighth of my Armpits; and then taking a Handful of the Reeds he had reserved by themselves, he laid them on my Back, tying them to the Bundle, close at my Shoulders, and again at the Ends. Now Peter, says he, stand up; which I did; but, it was full as much as I could do. I then seeing 
[Page 57]
Glanlepze laughing at the Figure I cut, desired him to be serious, and not put me upon loosing my Life for a Joke; for, I could not think what he would do next with me. He bid me never fear, and looking more soberly, ordered me to walk to the River, and so stand just within the Bank till he came; then leading the Muletto to me, he tied me to her, about a Yard from the Tail, and taking the Cord in his Hand, led the Muletto and me into the Water. We had not gone far before my Guide began to swim; then the Muletto and I were presently Chin deep, and I expected nothing but drowning every Moment; however, having gone so far, I was ashamed to cry out; when getting out of my Depth, and my Reeds coming to their bearing, up I mounted, and was carried on with all the Ease imaginable: My Conductor guiding us between the Trees so dexterously, that not one Accident happened to either of us all the Way, and we arrived safe on the opposite Shore. 
We had now got into a very low, close, swampy Country, and our Goat's Flesh began to be very stale, through the heat not only of the Sun but the Muletto's Back; however, we pleased ourselves we should have one more Meal of it before it was too bad to eat; so having travelled about three Miles from the River, we took up our Lodging on a little 
[Page 58]
Rising, and tyed our Muletto in a Valley about half a Furlong below us, where he made as good a Meal in his Way, as we did in ours. 
We had but just supped, and were sauntring about to find the easiest Spot to sleep on, when we heard a rustling and a grumbling Noise, in a small Thicket just on our Right; which seeming to approach nearer and nearer, Glanlepze roused himself, and was on his Legs, just Time enough to see a Lioness, and a small Whelp which accompanied her, within thirty Yards of us, making towards us, as we afterwards guessed, for the Sake of our Goat's Flesh, which now smelt very strong. Glanlepze whippped on the contrary Side of the Fire to that where the Goat's Flesh lay, and fell to kicking the Fire about at a great rate, which being made of dry Wood, caused innumerable Sparks to fly about us; but the Beasts still approaching in a couchant Manner, and seizing the Ribs of the Goat, and other Bones, for we had only cut the Flesh off, and grumbling and cracking them like rotten Twigs, Glanlepze snatched up a Fire-brand, flaming, in each Hand, and made towards them; which Sight so terrified the Creatures, that they fled with great Precipitation to the Thicket again. 
Glanlepze was a little uneasy at the Thoughts of quitting so good a Lodging as we had found, but yet held it best to move farther; for as the Lions 
[Page 59]
had left the Bones behind them, we must expect another Visit if we stayed there, and could hope for no Rest; and above all, we might possibly lose our Muletto; so we removed our Quarters two Miles further, where we slept with great Tranquility. 
Reflections on the Nature of Mankind, have often astonished me. I told you at first, my Thoughts concerning Prayer, in my Journey to Bristol, and of the Benefit I received from it, and how fully I was convinced of the Necessity of it; which one would think was a sufficient Motive to a reasonable Creature to be constant in it; and yet it is too true, that notwithstanding the Difficulties I had laboured under, and Hardships I had undergone, and the Danger of starving at Sea, or being murdered for Food by my Fellows, when there was as urgent a Necessity of begging divine Assistance as can be conceived, I never once thought of it, or of the Object of it, or returned Thanks for my being delivered, till the Lioness had just left me: And then I felt near the same Force, urging me to return Thanks for my Escape, as I had impelling me to Prayer before; and I think I did so with great Sincerity. 
I shall not trouble you with a Relation of the common Accidents of our Journey, which lasted two Months and better, or with the different Methods we used to get Subsistance; but shall at once 
[Page 60]
conduct you to Quamis: Only mention that we were sometimes obliged to go about; and were once stopped by a Cut that my Guide and Companion receiv'd by a ragged Stone in his Foot, which growing very bad almost deprived me of the Hopes of his Life; but, by Rest, and constant sucking and licking it, which was the only Remedy we had to apply, except green Leaves chewed, that I laid to it by his Direction, to supple and cool it, he soon began to be able to ride upon the Muletto, and sometimes to walk a little. 
I say, we arrived at Quamis, a small Place on a River of that Name, where Glanlepze had a neat Dwelling, and left a Wife and five Children when he went out to the Wars. We were very near the Town when the Day closed, and, as it is soon dark there after Sun-set, you could but just see your Hand at our Entrance into it. We met nobody in the Way, but I went directly to Glanlepze's Door, by his Direction, and struck two or three Strokes hard against it with my Stick. On this there came a Woman to it stark-naked. I asked her, in her own Language, if she knew one Glanlepze? She told me, with a deep Sigh, that once she did. I asked then, where he was? She said with their Ancestors, she hoped, for he was the greatest Warrior in the World; but, if he was not dead, he was in Slavery. Now, you must know, Glanlepze had a mind to 
[Page 61]
hear how his Wife took his Death, or Slavery, and had put me upon asking these Questions before he discovered himself. I proceeded then to tell her, I brought some News of Glanlepze, and was lately come from him, and by his Order. And does my dear Glanlepze live, says she, flying upon my Neck, and almost smothering me with Caresses, till I begged her to forbear, or she would strangle me, and I had a great deal more to tell her; then ringing for a Light, when she saw I was a white Man, she seem'd in the utmost Confusion at her own Nakedness, and immediately retiring, she threw a Cloth round her Waist, and came to me again. I then repeated to her, that her Husband was alive and well, but wanted a Ransom to redeem himself, and had sent me to see what she could any Ways raise for that Purpose. She told me, she and her Children had lived very hardly ever since he went from her, and she had nothing to sell, or make Money of, but her five Children; that, as this was the Time for the Slaving Trade, she would see what she could raise by them, and if that would not do, she would sell herself and send him the Money, if he would let her know how to do it. 
Glanlepze, who heard every Word that passed, finding so strong a Proof of his Wife's Affection, could hold out no longer, but, bursting into the Room, clasped her in his Arms, crying, no, 
[Page 62]
Zulika, for that was her Name, I am free; there will be no Occasion for your or my dear Children's Slavery; and rather than have purchased my Freedom at that Rate, I would willingly have died a Slave myself. But my own Ears have heard the tender Sentiments my Zulika has for me. Then, drowned in Tears of Joy, they embraced each other so close, and so long, that I thought it impertinent to be seen with them, till their first Transports were over. So I retir'd without the House, till Glanlepze called me in, which was not in less than full half an Hour. I admired at the Love and Constancy of the Persons I had just left behind me; and, good Heaven, thinks I to myself, with a Sigh, how happy has this our Escape rendered Glanlepze and his Wife! what a mutual Felicity do they feel! And what is the Cause of all this? Is it that he has brought Home great Treasures from the Wars? Nothing like it, he is come naked. Is it that having escaped Slavery and Poverty he is returned to an opulent Wife, abounding with the good Things of Life? No such Thing. What then can be the Cause of this Excess of Satisfaction, this alternate Joy, that Patty and I could not have been as happy with each other? Why, it was my Pride that interposed and prevented it. But what am I like to get by it, and by all this Travel, and these Hazards? Is this the Way to make a Fortune, to get an Estate? No 
[Page 63]
surely, the very contrary. I could not forsooth labour for Patty, and her Children, where I was known; but am I any better for labouring here, where I am not known, where I have no body to assist me, than I could have been where I am known, and where there would have been my Friends about me, at least, if they could have afforded no great Assistance. I have been deceived then, and have travelled so many thousand Miles, and undergone so many Dangers, only, to know at last, I had been happier at home; and have doubled my Misery, for want of Consideration, that very Consideration, which, impartially taken, would have convinced me, I ought to have made the best of my bad Circumstances, and to have laid hold of every commendable Method of improving them. Did I come hither to avoid daily Labour or voluntary Servitude at home? I have had it in Abundance. Did I come hither to avoid Poverty and Contempt? Here I have met with 'em ten fold. And now, after all, was I to return Home empty and naked, as Glanlepze has done; should I meet a Wife, as bare as myself, so ready to die in my Embraces, and to be a Slave herself, with her Children, for my Sake only? I fear not. 
These and the like Reflections had taken Possession of me, when Glanlepze called me in; where I found his Wife, in her Manner, preparing our Supper, with all that Chearfulness which gives a true Lustre to Innocence. 

[Page 64]
The Bustle we made, had by this Time awakened the Children; who, stark naked, as they were born, both Boys and Girls, came crawling out, and black as Jett, from behind a Curtain, at the further End of the Room, which was very long. The Father, as yet, had only enquired after them, but, upon Sight of them, he fell into an Extacy, kissing one, stroaking another, dandling a third, for the eldest was scarce fourteen; but not one of them knew him, for seven Years makes a great Chasm in young Memories. The more I saw of this Sport, the stronger Impressions Patty and my own Children made upon me. My Mind had been so much employed on my own Distresses, that those dear Ideas were almost effaced; but this moving Scene introduced them afresh, and imprinted 'em deeply on my Imagination, which cherished the sweet Remembrance.

CHAP. VIII. 

How the Author passed his Time with Glanlepze; his Acquaintance with some English Prisoners; they project an Escape; he joins them; they seize a Portugueze Ship, and get off; make a long run from Land; want Water; they anchor at a desert Island; the Boat goes on Shore for Water; they lose their Anchor in a Storm; the Author and one Adams drove to Sea; a miraculous Passage to a Rock; Adams drowned there; the Author's miserable Condition. 
I passed my Time with Glanlepze and his Wife, who both really loved me, with sufficient bodily Quiet, for about two Years; my Business was chiefly, in company with my Patron, to cultivate a Spot of Ground wherein we had planted Grain and Necessaries for the Family; and once or twice a Week we went a fishing; and sometimes hunted, and shot Venison. These were our chief Employments; for as to Excursions for Slaves, which is a Practice in many of those Countries, and what the Natives get Money by, since our own Slavery, Glanlepze and I could not endure it. 
Though I was tolerably easy in my external Circumstances, yet my Mind hankering after England made my Life still unhappy; and 
[Page 66]
that Infelicity daily increased, as I saw the less Probability of attaining my Desire. At length, hearing of some European Sailors, who were under Confinement for contraband Trade at a Portuguese Fort, about two Leagues from Quamis, I resolved to go to see them; and if any of them should be English, at least to enquire after my native Country. I went, and found two Dutchmen, who had been Sailors in British Pay several Years, three Scotchmen, an Irishman, and five Englishmen; but all had been long in English Merchants Service. They were taken, as they told me, by a Portugueze Vessel, together with their Ship, as a Dutch Prize, under Pretence of contraband Trade. The Captain was known to be a Dutchman, though he spoke good English, and was then in English Pay, and his Vessel English: Therefore they would have it that he was a Dutch Trader, and so seized his Ship in the Harbour, with the Prisoners in it. The Captain, who was on Shore with several of his Men, was threatned to be laid in Irons, if he was taken; which obliged him and his Men to abscond, and fly over Land, to an English Factory, for Assistance to recover his Ship and Cargoe; being afraid to appear, and claim it, amongst so many Enemies, without an additional Force. They had been in Confinement two Months, and their Ship confiscated and sold. In this miserable Condition I left them, but returned once or twice a Week, for a Fortnight or three Weeks, to 
[Page 67]
visit them. These Instances of Regard, as they thought them, created some Confidence in me, so that they conversed with me very freely. Amongst other Discourse, they told me one Day, that one of their Crew, who went with the Captain, had been taken ill on the Way, and being unable to proceed, was returned; but as he talked good Portuguese, he was not suspected to belong to them; and that he had been to visit them, and would be there again that Day. I had a Mind to see him, so stayed longer than I intended, and in about an Hour's Time he came. After he was seated, he asked, who I was? and, privately, if I might be trusted? Being satisfied I might, for that I was a Cornish Man, he began as follows, looking narrowly about to see he was not overheard: My Lads, says he, be of good Courage, I have hopes for you, be but Men, and we shall see better Days yet. I wondered to what this Preface tended, when he told us, That since his return from the Captain, as he spoke good Portugueze, and had failed on board Portugueze Traders several Years, he mixed among that People, and particularly among the Crew of the Del Cruz, the Ship which had taken them; that that Ship had partly unloaded, and was taking in other Goods for a future Voyage; that he had informed himself of their Strength, and that very seldom more than three Men and two Boys lay on Board; that he had 
[Page 68]
hired himself to the Captain, and was to go on board the very next Day. Now, says he, my Lads, if you can break Prison any Night after To-morrow, and come directly to the Ship, (telling them how she lay, for, says he, you can't mistake, you will find two or three Boats moored in the Gut against the Church) I will be ready to receive you, and wee'll get off with her, in lieu of our Ship they have taken from us; for there is nothing ready to follow us. 
The Prisoners listned to this Discourse very attentively; but scratched their heads, fearing the difficulty of it, and severer usage if they miscarried, and made several Objections; but, at last, they all swore to attempt it, the Night but one following. Upon which the Sailor went away, to prepare for their Reception on board. After he was gone, I surveyed his Scheme attentively in my own Mind, and found it not so difficult as I first imagined, if the Prisoners could but escape cleverly. So, before I went away, I told them, I approved of their Purpose; and as I was their Countryman, I was resolved, with their Leaves, to risk my Fortune with them. At this they seemed much pleased, and all embraced me. We then fixed the peremptory Night, and I was to wait at the Water-Side, and get the Boats in Readiness. 
The Prison they were in was a Portugueze Fort, which had been deserted: ever since the building a much better on the other Side of 
[Page 69]
the River, a Gun-shot lower. It was built with Walls too thick for naked Men to storm; the Captives were securely locked up every Night; and two Soldiers, or Centinels, kept watch in an outer Room, who were relieved from the Main Guard in the Body of the Building. 
The expected Night arrived; and a little before Midnight, as had been concerted, one of the Prisoners cried out, he was so parched up, he was on Fire, he was on Fire. The Centinels were both asleep; but the first that waked, called at the Door, to know what was the Matter; the Prisoner still crying out, I am on Fire, the rest begged the Centinel to bring a Bowl of Water for him, for they knew not what ailed him. 
The good natured Fellow, without waking his Companion, brought the Water, and having a Lamp in the Guard-Room, opened the Door; when the Prisoners seizing his Arms, and commanding him to silence, bound his Hands behind him, and his Feet together; then serving the other in the same Manner, who was now just awake, and taking from 'em their Swords and Musquets, they made the best of their Way over the Fort Wall; which, being built with Buttresses on the Inside, was easily surmounted. Being got out, they were not long a finding me, who had before this Time made the Boats ready, and was impatiently waiting for them; so in we all got, and made good Speed 
[Page 70]
to the Ship, where we were welcomed by our Companion, ready to receive us. 
Under Pretence of being a new entered Sailor, he had carried some Madeira Wine on board, and treated the Men and Boys so freely, that he had thrown 'em into a dead Sleep; which was a wise Precaution. There being now therefore no Fear of Disturbance, nor Interruption, we drew up the two Boats, and set all Hands at work to put the Ship under Way; and plyed it so closely, the Wind favouring us, that by eleven o'Clock the next Morning, we were out of Sight of Land; but we set the Men and Boys adrift, in one of the Boats, nigh the Mouth of the River. 
The first Thing we did, after we had made a long run from Shore, was to consult what Course to steer. Now, as there was a valuable Loading on board, of Goods from Portugal, and others taken in since, some gave their Opinion for sailing directly to India, selling the Ship and Cargo there, and returning by some English Vessel. But that was rejected; for we did not doubt but Notice would be given of our Escape along the Coast; and if we should fall into the Portuguese Hands, we could expect no Mercy; besides we had not People sufficient for such an Enterprize. Others again, were for sailing the directest Course for England. But, I told them, as our Opinions were different, and no 
[Page 71]
Time was to be lost, my Advice was, to stretch Southward, till we might be quite out of Fear of Pursuit, and then, whatever Course we took, by keeping clear of all Coasts we might hope to come safe off. 
My Proposal seem'd to please the whole Crew; so, crowding all the Sail we could, we pushed Southward very briskly, before the Wind, for several Days. We now went upon examining our Stores, and found we had Flour enough, Plenty of Fish, and Salt Provisions, but were scant of Water and Wood: Of the first whereof there was not half a Ton, and but very little of the latter. This made us very uneasy; and being none of us expert in Navigation, farther than the common working of the Ship, and having no Chart on board, that might direct us to the nearest Land, we were almost at our Wit's End, and came to a short Allowance of Liquor. That we must get Water if we could, was indisputable; but where to do it puzzled us: As we had determined not to get in with the African Shore, on any Account whatever, 
In this Perplexity, and under the Guidance of different Opinions, for we were all Captains now, we sometimes steered Eastward, and sometimes Westward for about nine Days; when we espied a little bluish Cloud-like Appearance, to the South-West. This continuing, we hoped it might be Land, and therefore made to it. 
[Page 72]
Upon our nearer Approach, we found it to be, as we judged, an Island; but, not knowing its Name, or whether it was inhabited, we coasted round it two Days, to satisfy ourselves as to this last Particular. Seeing no living Creature on it during that time, and the Shore being very broken, we came to an Anchor about two Miles from it, and sent ten of our Crew in our best Boat, with some Casks, to get Water and cut Wood. The Boat returned at Night, with six Men, and the Casks fill'd, having left four behind, to go on with the cutting of Wood against next Day. Accordingly next Morning the Boat went off again, and made two Turns with Water and Wood ere Night; which was repeated for two or three Days after. On the sixth she went off for Wood only, leaving none but me and one John Adams a Board. 
The Boat had scarce reach'd the Island, this last Turn, before the Day overcast, and there arose such a Storm of Wind, Thunder, Lightning, and Hail, as I had never before seen. At last our Cable broke close to the Anchor, and away we went with the Wind, full Southward by West; and not having Strength to keep the Ship upon a side wind, we were forced to set her Head right before it, and let her drive. Our Hope was, every Hour, the Storm would abate; but it continued with equal Violence for many Days; during all which Time, neither Adams or I had any rest; for one, or other of us was forced, and sometimes both, 
[Page 73]
to keep her right before the Wind, or she would certainly have overset. When the Storm abated, as it did by Degrees, neither Adams or I could tell where we were, or even in what Part of the World. 
I was sorry I had no better a Sailor with me, for neither Adams or myself had ever made more than one Voyage till now; so that we were both unacquainted with the Latitude, and scarce knew the Use of the Compass to any Purpose; and, being out of all Hope of ever reaching the Island, to our Companions, we neither knew which Way to steer, or what to do. And indeed, had we known where we were, we two only could not have been able to navigate the Ship to any Part we desired; or ever get to the Island, unless such a Wind as we had before, would of itself have driven us thither. 
Whilst we were considering Day after Day what to do, though the Sea was now very calm and smooth, the Ship seemed to sail at as great a Rate as before; which we attributed to the Velocity she had acquired by the Storm, or to Currents that had set that Way by the Violence of the Winds. Contenting ourselves with this, we expected all soon to be right again; and as we had no Prospect of ever seeing our Companions, we kept the best look out we could, to see for any Vessel coming that Course, which might take us in; and resolved to rest all our Hopes upon that. 

[Page 74]
When we had sailed a good while after this manner, we knew not whither, Adams called out, I see land. My Heart leaped within me for Joy, and we hoped, the current that seem'd to carry us so fast, set in for some Islands or Rivers that lay before us. But still we were exceedingly puzzled at the Ship's making such Way; and the nearer and nearer we approached the Land, which was now very visible, the more speed the Ship made; though there was no Wind stirring. We had but just Time to think on this unexpected Phænomenon, when we found, that what we had taken for Land, was a Rock of an extraordinary Height, to which, as we advanced nearer, the Ship increased its Motion; and all our Strength could not make her answer her Rudder any other Way. This put us under the Apprehension of being dashed to Pieces immediately; and in less than half an Hour, I verily thought my Fears had not been groundless. Poor Adams told me he would try, when the Ship struck, if he could leap upon the Rock, and ran to the Head for that Purpose; but I was so fearful of seeing my Danger, that I ran under Hatches, resolving to sink in the Ship. We had no sooner parted, but I felt so violent a Shock, that I verily thought the Ship had brought down the whole Rock upon her, and been thereby dashed to Pieces; so that I never more expected to see the Light. 

[Page 75]
I lay under this Terror for at least half an Hour; waiting the Ship's either filling with Water or bulging every Moment. But finding neither Motion in her, or any Water rise, or the least Noise whatsoever, I ventured with an aching Heart from my Retreat, and stole up the Hatchway, as if an Enemy had been on Deck, peeping first one Way, then another. Here nothing presented but Confusion; the Rock hung over the Hatchway, at about twenty Feet above my Head, our Foremast lay by the Board, the Mainmast Yardarm was down, and great Part of the Mainmast snapped off with it, and almost every thing upon Deck was displaced. This Sight shocked me extremely; and calling for Adams, in whom I hoped to find some comfort, I was too soon convinced I had lost him. 
CHAP. IX. 

Wilkins thinks of destroying himself; his Soliloquy; strange Accident in the Hold; his Surprize; can't climb the Rock; his Method to sweeten his Water; lives many Months on board; ventures to Sea in his Boat several Times, and takes many Fish; almost overcome by an Eel. 
After I had stood a while in the utmost Confusion of Thought, and my Spirits began 
[Page 76]
to be a little composed, I was resolved to see what Damage the Hull of the Ship had received. Accordingly I looked narrowly, but could find none, only she was immovably fixed in a Cleft of the Rock, like a large Arch-way; and there stuck so fast, that tho', upon fathoming, I could find no Bottom, she never moved in the least, by the Working of the Water. 
I now began to look upon Adams as a happy Man, being delivered by immediate Death from such an inextricable Scene of Distress, and wish'd myself with him a thousand Times. I had a great Mind to have followed him into the other World; yet, I know not how it is, there is something so abhorrent to human Nature, in Self-Murder, be one's Condition what it will, that I was soon determined on the contrary Side. Now again I perceived that the Almighty had given me a large Field to expatiate in upon the Trial of his Creatures; by bringing them into imminent Dangers, ready to overwhelm them, and at the same Time, as it were, hanging out the Flag of Truce and Mercy to them. These Thoughts brought me to my Knees, and I pour'd out my Soul to God, in a Strain of Humiliation, Resignation to his Will, and earnest Petitions for Deliverance, or Support in this Distress. Having finished, I found myself in a more composed Frame; so having eaten a Biscuit, and drank a Can of Water, and not seeing any 
[Page 77]
Thing to be done whereby I could better my Condition, I sat me down upon the Deck, and fell into the following Soliloquy. 
Peter, says I, what have you to do here? Alas, reply'd I to myself, I am fixed against my Will, in this dismal Mansion, destin'd, as Rats might be, to devour the Provisions only, and, having eat all up, to perish with Hunger for Want of a Supply. Then, says I, of what Use are you in the World, Peter? Truly, answer'd I, of no other Use, that I can see, but to be an Object of Misery for divine Vengeance to work upon, and to shew, what a deplorable State human Nature can be reduced to: For I can't think any one else can be so wretched. And again, Peter, says I, what have you been doing ever since you came into the World? I am afraid, says I, I can answer no better to this Question than to either of the former; for, if only reasonable Actions are to be reckoned among my Doings, I am sure I have done little worth recording. For, let me see, what it all amounts to: I spent my first sixteen Years, in making a Fool of my Mother; my three next in letting her make a Fool of me; and in being Fool enough myself to get me a Wise and two Children before I was twenty. The next Year was spent in finding out the Misery of Slavery from Experience. Two Years more I repin'd at the Happiness 
[Page 78]
of my Benefactor, and at finding it was not my Lot to enjoy the same. This Year is not yet spent, aud how many more are to come, and where they may be pass'd, and what they may produce, requires a better Head than mine even to guess at; but certainly my present Situation seems to promise nothing beside Woe and Misery. But hold a little, says I, and let me clearly state my own Wretchedness. I am here, 'tis true, but for any Good I have ever done, or any Advantage I have reaped in other Places, I am as well here as any where. I have no present Want of Food, or unjust or cruel Enemy to annoy me; so, as long as the Ship continues entire, and Provisions last, I shall do tolerably. Then, why should I grieve or terrify myself about what may come. What my frighted Imagination suggests may perhaps never happen. Deliverance, though not to be looked for, is yet possible. And my future Fate may be as different from my present Condition, as this is from the Hopes with which I lately flattered myself. And why, after all, may I not die a natural Death here, as well as any where? All Mankind do die, and then there is an End of all. -An End of all, did I say,-no, there is something within that gives me the Lie, when I say so. Let me see, Death (my Master used to say) is not an End, but a Beginning of real Life. And may it not be so? -May I not as well undergo 
[Page 79]
a Change, from this to a different State of Life, when I leave this World, as be born into it, I know not from whence? Who sent me into this World? Who framed me of two Natures so unlike, that Death cannot destroy but one of them? It must be the Almighty God: But all God's Works tend to some End. And if he has given me an immortal Nature, it must be his Intention that I should live somewhere and somehow for ever. May not this Stage of Being then be only an Introduction to, a Preparative for, another? There is nothing in this Supposition repugnant to Reason. Upon the whole; if God is the Author of my Being, he only has a Right to dispose of it; and I may not put an End thereto without his Leave. It is no less true, that my continuing therein during his Pleasure, and because it is so, may turn vastly to my Advantage in his good Time; it may be the Means of my becoming happy for ever, when it is his Will that I go hence. It is no less probable, that, dismal as my present Circumstances appear, I may be even now the Object of a kind Providence. God may be leading me by Affliction to Repentance of former Crimes; destroying those sensual Affections that have all my Days kept me from loving and serving him. I will therefore submit myself to his Will, and hope for his Mercy. 

[Page 80]
These Thoughts and many others I then had composed me very much, and by Degrees reconciled me to my destined Solitude. I walked my Ship, of which I was now both Master and Owner, and employed myself in searching how it was fastened to the Rock, and where it rested; but all to no Purpose, as to that particular. I then struck a Light, and went into the Hold, to see what I could find useful; for we had never searched the Ship since we took her. 
In the Hold, I found Abundance of long Iron Bars, which I suppose were brought out to be trafficked with the Blacks. I observed they lay all with one End close to the Head of the Ship, which I presumed was occasioned by the violent Shock they received when she struck against the Rock; but seeing one short Bar lying out beyond the Rest, though touching at the End one of the long Bars, I thought to take it up, and lay it on the Heap with the others; but the Moment I had raised the End next the other Bars, it flew out of my Hand, with such Violence, against the Head of the Ship, and with such a Noise, as greatly surprised me, and put me in fear it had broke through the Plank. 
I just stay'd to see no harm was done, and run upon Deck, with my Hair stiff on my Head; nor could I conceive less, than that some subtil Spirit had done this Prank, meerly to terrify me. 

[Page 81]
It ran in my Pate several Days, and I durst upon no Account have gone into the Hold again, though my whole Support had lain there; nay, it even spoiled my Rest, for fear something tragical should befall me, of which this amazing Incident was an Omen. 
About a Week after, as I was shifting myself, (for I had not taken my Cloaths off since I came there) and putting on a new Pair of Shoes which I found on Board, my own being very bad, taking out my Iron Buckles, I laid one of them upon a broken Piece of the Mast that I sat upon; when, to my Astonishment, it was no sooner out of my Hand, but up it flew to the Rock, and stuck there. I could not tell what to make of it; but was sorry the Devil had got above Deck. I then held several other Things, one after another, in my Hand, and laid them down where I laid the Buckle, but nothing stirred, till I took out the Fellow of that from the Shoes; when letting it go, away it jumped also to the Rock. 
I mused on these Phenomena for some Time, and could not forbear calling upon God to protect me from the Devil, who must as I imagined have a Hand in such unaccountable Things, as they then seemed to me. But at Length Reason got the better of these foolish Apprehensions, and I began to Think there might be some natural Cause of them, and next to be very desirous 
[Page 82]
of finding it out. In order to this I set about making Experiments, to try what would run to the Rock, and what would not. I went into the Captain's Cabin, and opening a Cupboard, of which the Key was in the Door, I took out a Pipe, a Bottle, a Pocket-Book, a Silver Spoon, a Tea-cup, &c. and laid 'em successively near the Rock; when none of them answered; but the Key which I had brought out of the Cupboard, on my Finger, dropping off, while I was thus employed, no sooner it was disengaged, but away it went to it. After that I tryed several other Pieces of Iron-ware, with the like Success. Upon this, and the Needle of my Compass standing stiff to the Rock, I concluded that this same Rock contained great Quantity of Loadstone, or was itself one vast Magnet, and that our Lading of Iron was the Cause of the Ship's violent Course thereto, which I mentioned before. 
This quite satisfied me, as to my Notion of Spirits, and gave me a more undisturbed Night's Rest than I had had before; so that now, having nothing to affright me, I passed the Time tolerably well in my Solitude, as it grew by Degrees familiar to me. 
I had often wished it had been possible for me to climb the Rock; but it was so smooth in many Places, and craggy in others, and over hanging, continuing just the same to the Right and Left of me as far as ever I could see, that from the 
[Page 83]
Impossibility of it, I discharged all Thoughts of such an Attempt. 
I had now lived on board three Months, and perceived the Days grow shorter and shorter, 'till, having lost the Sun for a little Time, they were quite dark: That is, there was no absolute Day-light, or indeed visible Distinction between Day and Night; though it was never so dark, but I could see well enough upon Deck to go about. 
What now concerned me the most was, my Water, which began to grow very bad (though I had plenty of it) and unsavory, so that I could scarce drink it; but had no Prospect of better. Now and then indeed it snowed a little, which I made some use of; but this was far from contenting me. Hereupon I began to contrive, and having nothing else to do, I set two open Vessels upon Deck, and drawing Water from the Hold, I filled one of my Vessels, and letting it stand a Day and a Night, I poured it into the other, and so shifted it every twenty-four Hours; this, I found, though it did not bring it to the primitive Taste, and render it altogether palatable, was nevertheless a great Help to it, by incorporating the fresh Air with it; so that it became very potable: And this Method I constantly used with my drinking Water, so long as I stayed on board the Ship. 
It had now been sharp Weather for some Time; 
[Page 84]
and the Cold still increasing, this put me upon rumaging the Ship further than ever I thought to do before; when opening a little Cabin under Deck, I found a large Cargo of fine French Brandy, a great many Bottles and some small Casks of Madeira Wine, with divers Cordial Waters. Having tasted these, and taken out a Bottle or two of Brandy, and some Madeira, I locked up my Door, and looked no farther that Time. 
The next Day I inquired into my Provisions; and some of my Flesh having soaked out the Pickle, I made fresh Pickle, and closed it up again. I that Day also found several Cheeses, cased up in Lead, one of which I then opened and dined upon: But what Time of Day or Night it was when I eat this Meal I could not tell. I found a great many Chests well filled, and one or two of Tools, which some Years after stood me in a very good stead; though I did not expect they would ever be of that Service when I first met with them. 
In this Manner I spent my Time till I began to see broad Day-light again, which cheared me greatly. I had been often put in hopes, during the dark Season, that Ships were coming towards me, and that I should once more have the Conversation of Mankind; for I had, by the small glimmering, seen many large Bodies (to my thinking) move at a little Distance from me, and particularly toward the re-appearing of the Light; but though 
[Page 85]
I hallowed as loud as I could, and often fired my Gun, I never received an Answer. 
When the Light returned, my Days increased in Proportion as they had before decreased; and gathering Comfort from that, I determined to launch my small Boat, and to coast along the Island, as I judged it, to see if it was inhabited, and by whom; I determin'd also to make me some Lines for Fishing, and carry my Gun, to try for other Game, if I found a Place for Landing: For though I had never, since my Arrival, seen a single living Creature but my Cat, except Insects, of which there were many in the Water, and in the Air, before the dark Weather, and then began to appear again; yet I could not but think there were both Birds and Beasts to be met with. 
Upon launching my Boat, I perceived she was very leaky; so I let her fill, and continue thus a Week or more, to stop her Cracks; then getting down the Side of my Ship, I scooped her quite dry, and found her very fit for use; so, putting on board my Gun, Lines, Brandy Bottle, and a Cloaths-chest for a Seat, with some little Water, and Provisions for a Week, I once more committed myself to the Sea: Having taken all the Observation I could, to gain my Ship again, if any Accident should happen; tho' I resolved, upon no Account, to quit sight of the Rock willingly. 
I had not row'd very long, before I thought 
[Page 86]
I saw an Island to my right, about a League distant, to which I inclined to steer my Course, the Sea being very calm; but, upon surveying it nearer, I found it only a great Cake of Ice, about forty Yards high above the Water, and a Mile or two in length. I then concluded, that what I had before taken for Ships, were only these Lumps of Ice. Being thus disappointed as to my Island, I made what haste I could back to the Rock again, and coasted part of its Circumference; but tho' I had gone two or three Leagues of its Circuit, the Prospect it afforded was just the same. 
I then try'd my Lines, by fastning several very long ones, made of the Log-line, to the Side of the Boat, baiting them with several different Baits, but took only one Fish of about four Pounds weight, very much resembling a Haddock; part of which I dress'd for my Supper, after my Return to the Ship, and it proved very good. Towards Evening I return'd to my Home, as I may call it. 
The next Day I made a Voyage on the other Side of the Rock, tho' but to a small Distance from the Ship, with Intent only to fish, but took nothing. I had then a Mind to victual my Boat, or little Cruizer, and prepare myself for a Voyage of two or three Days; which I thought I might safely undertake, as I had never seen a troubled Sea since I came to the Island; 
[Page 87]
for, tho' I heard the Wind often roaring over my Head, yet it coming always from the Land-side, it never disturbed the Water near Shore. I set out the same Way I went at first, designing to fail two or three Days out, and as many Home again; and resolved, if possible, to fathom the Depth as I went. With this View I prepared a very long Line, with a large Shot tyed in a Rag at the End of it, by way of Plummet; but I felt no Ground 'till the second Night. The next Morning I came into thirty fathom Water, then twenty, then sixteen. In both Tours I could perceive no Abatement in the Height or Steepness of the Rock. 
In about fourteen Fathom Water I drop'd my Lines, and lay by for an Hour or two. Feeling several Jars, as I sat on my Chest in the Boat, I was sure I had caught somewhat; so pulling up my Lines, successively, I brought first a large Eel, near six Feet long, and almost as thick as my Thigh, whose Mouth, Throat, and Fins, were of a fine Scarlet, and the Belly as white as Snow: He was so strong, while in the Water, and weighty, I had much ado to get him into the Boat, and then had a harder Job to kill him; for though, having a Hatchet with me, to cut Wood in case I met with any landing Place, I chopped off his Head, the Moment I had him on board, yet he had several Times after that liked to have broken my Legs, 
[Page 88]
and beat me overboard, before I had quite taken his Life from him; and, had I not whip'd off his Tail, and also divided his Body into two or three Pieces, I could not have master'd him. The next I pull'd up was a thick Fish like a Tench, but of another Colour and much bigger. I drew up several others, flat and long Fish, till I was tired with the Sport; and then I set out for the Ship again, which I reach'd the third Day. 
During this whole time I had but one Shot, and that was as I came homewards, at a Creature I saw upon a high Crag of the Rock, which I fired at with Ball, fearing that my small Shot would not reach it. The Animal, being mortally wounded, bounded up, and came tumbling down the Rock, very near me. I pick'd it up, and found it to be a Creature not much unlike our Rabbits, but with shorter Ears, a longer Tail, and hoofed like a Kid, tho' it had the perfect Fluck of a Rabbit. I put it into my Boat, to contemplate on when I arrived at the Ship; and plying my Oars, got safe, as I said, on the third Day. 
I made me a Fire, to cook with, as soon as I had got my Cargo out of the Boat into my Ship, but was under Debate which of my Dainties to begin upon. I had sometimes a Mind to have broil'd my Rabbit, as I called it, and boiled some of my Fish; but, being tired, I hung up 
[Page 89]
my Flesh till the next Day, and boiled two or three Sorts of my Fish, to try which was best. I knew not the Nature of most of them, so I boiled a Piece of my Eel, to be sure, judging that, however I might like the others, I should certainly be able to make a good Meal of that. This Variety being ready, I took a little of my Oil out of the Hold for Sauce, and sat down to my Meal, as satisfied as an Emperor. But upon tasting my several Messes, though the Eel was rather richer than the smaller Fishes, yet the others were all so good, I gave them the Preference for that Time, and laid by the rest of the Eel, and of the other Fish, till the next Day, when I salted them for future spending. 
I kept now a whole Week or more at home, to look further into the Contents of the Ship, bottle off a Cask of Madeira, which I found leaking, and to consume my new Stores of Fish, and Flesh; which being somewhat stale, when first salted, I thought would not keep so well as the old ones that were on board. I added also some fresh Bread to my Provision, and sweetned more Water, by the aforementioned Method; and when my necessary domestick Affairs were brought under, I then projected a new Voyage. 

[Page 90]

CHAP. X. 

Lays in great Store of Provision; resolves to traverse the Rock; sails for three Weeks, still seeing it only; is sucked under the Rock, and hurried down a Cataract; continues there five Weeks; his Description of the Cavern; his Thoughts, and Difficulties; his Arrival at a great Lake; and his landing in the beautiful Country of Graundevolet. 
I had for a long Time wanted to see the other Side of the Rock, and at last resolved to try if I could not coast it quite round; for, as I reasoned with myself, I might possibly find some landing Places, and perhaps a convenient Habitation on Shore. But as I was very uncertain what Time that might take up, I determined on having Provisions, Instruments of divers Kinds, and necessary Utensils in plenty, to guard against Accidents as well as I could. I therefore took another Sea Chest out of the Hold of the Ship, and letting it into my Boat, replenish'd it with a Stock of Wine, Brandy, Oil, Bread, and the like, sufficient for a considerable Voyage. I also filled a large Cask with Water, and took a good Quantity of Salt, to cure what Fish I should take by the Way. I carried two Guns, two Brace of Pistols, and other Arms, with Ammunition proportionable; also an Ax or two, a 
[Page 91]
Saw to cut Wood, if I should see any, and a few other Tools, which might be highly serviceable if I could land. To all these I added an old Sail, to make a Covering for my Goods and Artillery against the Weather. Thus furnished and equipped, having secur'd my Hatches on board, and every Thing that might spoil by wet, I set out (with a God's Speed) on my Expedition; committing myself once more to Providence and the main Ocean, and proceeding the same Way I went the first Time. 
I did not sail extraordinary fast, but frequently fished in proper Places, and caught a great deal; salting and drying the best of what I took. For three Weeks Time and more, I saw no Entrance into the Island, as I call it, nor any thing but the same unscalable Rock. This uniform Prospect gave me so little Hopes of landing, that I was almost of a mind to have return'd again. But, on mature Deliberation, resolving to go forward a Day or two more, I had not proceeded twenty-four Hours, when, just as it was becoming dark, I heard a great Noise, as of a Fall of Water; whereupon I purposed to lye by and wait for Day, to see what it was; but, the Stream insensibly drawing me on, I soon found myself in an Eddy; and the Boat drawing forward, beyond all my Power to resist it, I was quickly sucked under a low Arch, where, if I had not fallen flat in my Boat, having 
[Page 92]
barely Light enough to see my Danger, I had undoubtedly been crushed to Pieces, or driven over-board. I could perceive the Boat to fall with incredible Violence, as I thought, down a Precipice, and suddenly whirled round and round with me; the Water roaring on all Sides, and dashing against the Rock with a most amazing Noise. 
I expected every Moment my poor little Vessel would be staved against the Rock, and I overwhelm'd with Waters; and for that Reason never once attempted to rise up, or look upon my Peril, till after the Commotion had in some Measure ceased. At length, finding the Perturbation of the Water abate, and as if by Degrees I came into a smoother Stream, I took courage just to lift up my affrighted Head; but, guess if you can, the Horror which seiz'd me, on finding myself in the blackest of Darkness, unable to perceive the smallest Glimmer of Light. 
However, as my Boat seemed to glide easily, I roused myself, and struck a Light; but if I had my Terrors before, what must I have now; I was quite stupified, at the tremendous View of an immense Arch over my Head, to which I could see no Bounds; the Stream itself, as I judged, was about thirty Yards broad, but in some Places wider in some narrower. It was well for me I happened to have a 
[Page 93]
Tinder-box, or, though I had escaped hitherto, I must have at last perished; for in the narrower Parts of the Stream, where it ran swiftest, there were frequently such Craggs stood out from the Rock, by Reason of the Turnings and Windings, and such Setts of the Current against them, as, could I not have seen to manage my Boat, which I took great care to keep in the middle of the Stream, must have thrown me on them to my inevitable Destruction. 
Happy it was for me also, I was so well victualled, and that I had taken with me two Bottles of Oyl, (as I supposed, for I did not imagine I had any more) or I had certainly been lost; not only through Hunger, for I was, to my Guess, five Weeks in the Vault or Cavern, but for want of Light, which the Oyl furnished, and without which all other Conveniences could have been of no Avail to me. I was forced to keep my Lamp always burning; so, not knowing how long my Residence was to be in that Place, or when I should get my Discharge from it, if ever, I was obliged to husband my Oyl with the utmost Frugality; and notwithstanding all my Caution, it grew low, and was just spent, in little above half the Time I stayed there. 
I had now cut a Piece of my Shirt, for a Wick to my last Drop of Oyl, which I twisted and light. I burnt the Oyl in my Brass Tobacco-Box, 
[Page 94]
which I had fitted pretty well to answer the Purpose. Sitting down, I had many black Thoughts, of what must follow the Loss of my Light, which I considered as near expiring, and that, I feared, for ever. I am here, thought I, like a poor condemned Criminal, who knows his Execution is fixed for such a Day, nay such an Hour, and dies over and over in Imagination, and by the Torture of his Mind, till that Hour comes: That Hour, which he so much dreads! and yet that very Hour which releases him from all further dread. Thus do I, my last Wick is kindled; my last Drop of Fuel is consuming; and I am every Moment apprehending the Shocks of the Rock, the Suffocation of the Water; and, in short, thinking over my dying Thoughts, till the Snuff of my Lamp throws up its last curling expiring Flame, and then my Quietus will be presently signed, and I released from my tormenting Anxiety. Happy Minute, come then, I only wait for thee. 
My Spirits grew so low and feeble upon this, that I had recourse to my Brandy Bottle, to raise them. But as I was just going to take a Sip, I reflected that would only encrease Thirst, and therefore it were better to take a little of my white Madeira. So, putting my Dram-bottle again into the Chest, I held up one of Madeira 
[Page 95]
as I fancied, to the Lamp, and seeing it was white, for I had red too, I clapped it eagerly to my Mouth; when, the first Gulp gave me a greater Refreshment, and more cheered my Heart, than all the other Liquors I had put together could have done, insomuch as I had almost leaped over the Boat's Side for Joy: It is Oil, cry'd I aloud, it is Oil. I set it down carefully, with inexpressible Pleasure, and examining the rest of the Bottles I had taken for white Madrira, I found two more of those to be filled with Oil, Now, says I, here is the counterpart of my condemned Prisoner. For let but a Pardon come, though at the Gallows, how soon does he forget he has been an unhappy Villain. And I too have scarce a Notion now, how a Man in my Case could feel such Sorrow as I have, for want of a little Oil. 
After my first Transport, I found myself grow serious; reflecting upon the Vigilance of Providence over us poor Creatures, and the various Instances wherein it interposes to save or relieve us, in Cases of the deepest Distress, where our own Foresight, Wisdom, and Power have utterly failed, and when, looking all around, we could discover no Means of Deliverance. And I saw a Train of Circumstances leading to the Incident I have just mentioned, which obliged me to acknowledge the Superintendence of Heaven 
[Page 96]
over even my Affairs. And as the Goodness of God had cared for me thus far, and manifested itself to me now, in rescuing me, as it were, from being swallowed up in Darkness; I had ground to hope he intended a compleat Deliverance of me, out of that dismal Abyss, and would cause me yet to praise him in the full Brightness of Day. 
A Series of these Meditations brought me, at the End of five Weeks, as nearly as I could compute it by my Lamp, to a prodigious Lake of Water, bordered with a grassy Down, about half a Mile wide, of the finest Verdure I had ever seen; this again was flanked with a Wood or Grove, rising like an Amphitheatre, of about the same Breadth; and behind, and above all, appeared the naked Rock, to an immense Height. 

[Page 97]

CHAP. XI. 

His Joy on his Arrival at Land; a Description of the Place; no Inhabitants; wants fresh Water; resides in a Grotto; finds Water; views the Country; carries his Things to the Grotto; 
It is impossible to express my Joy at the Sight of Day once more. I got on the Land as soon as possible, after my Dismission from the Cavern, and kneeling on the Ground, returned hearty Thanks to God for my Deliverance, begging, at the same time, Grace to improve his Mercies, and that I might continue under his Protection, whatever should hereafter befal me, and at last die on my native Soil. 
I unloaded my Vessel, as well as I could, and hauled her up on the Shore; and turning her upside down, made her a covering for my Arms and Baggage; I then sat down to contemplate the Place, and eat a most delightful Meal on the Grass, being quite a new Thing to me. 
I walked over the green Swarth to the Wood, with my Gun in my Hand, a Brace of Pistols in my Girdle, and my Cutlass hanging before me. But when I was just entring the Wood, looking behind me, and all around the Plain, is it possible, says I, that so much Art, for I did not then believe it was natural, could have 
[Page 98]
been bestowed upon this Place, and no Inhabitant in it? Here are neither Buildings, Huts, Castle, or any living Creature to be seen; it cannot be, says I, that this Place was made for nothing. 
I then went a considerable Way into the Wood, and inclined to have gone much further, it being very beautiful, but, on second Thoughts, judged it best to content myself at present with only looking out a safe Retreat, for that Night; for however agreeable the Place then seemed, Darkness was at hand, when every thing about me would have more or less of Horror in it. 
The Wood, at its first Entrance, was composed of the most charming flowering Shrubs that can be imagined; each growing upon its own Stem, at so convenient a Distance from the other, that you might fairly pass between them any Way, without the least Incommodity. Behind them grew numberless Trees, somewhat taller, of the greatest Variety of Shapes, Forms, and Verdures, the Eye ever beheld; each also, so far asunder, as was necessary for the spreading of their several Branches, and the Growth of their delicious Fruits, without a Bush, Briar, or Shrub amongst them. Behind these, and still on the higher Ground, grew an infinite Number of very large tall Trees, much loftier than the former; but intermixed with some 
[Page 99]
Underwood, which grew thicker and closer, the nearer you approached the Rock. I made a shift to force my Way through these, as far as the Rock, which rose as perpendicular as a regular Building, having only here and there some Crags and Unevennesses. There was, I observed, a Space all the Way between the Underwood and the Rock, wide enough to drive a Cart in; and indeed I thought it had been left for that Purpose. 
I walked along this Passage a good Way; having tied a Rag of the Lining of my Jacket at the Place of my Entrance, to know it again at my coming back, which I intended to be e're it grew dark; but I found so much Pleasure in the Walk, and surveying a small natural Grotto which was in the Rock, that the Day-light forsook me unawares; whereupon I resolved to put off my return unto the Boat till next Morning, and to take up my Lodging for that Night in the Cave. 
I cut down a large Bundle of Underwood, with my Cutlass, sufficient to stop up the Mouth of the Grotto, and laying me down to rest, slept as sound, as if I had been on board my Ship; for I never had one Hour's Rest together, since I shot the Gulph, till this. Nature indeed could not have supported itself thus long under much Labour; but as I had nothing to do, but only keep the middle Stream, I began to be as used 
[Page 100]
to guide myself in it, with my Eyes almost closed, and my Senses retired, as a Higler is to drive the Cart to Market in his Sleep. 
The next Morning I awaked sweetly refresh'd, and, by the Sign of my Rag, found the Way again thro' the Underwood to my Boat. I raised that up a little, took out some Bread and Cheese, and having eat pretty heartily, laid me down to drink at the Lake, which looked as clear as Chrystal, expecting a most delicious Draught: But, I had forgot it brought me from the Sea, and my first Gulph almost poisoned me. This was a sore Disappointment, for I knew my Water Cask was nigh emptied; and indeed, turning up my Boat again, I drew out all what remained, and drank it, for I was much a-thirst. 
However, I did not despair; I was now so used to God's Providence, and had a Sense of its Operations so rivetted in my Mind, that though the vast Lake of salt Water was surrounded by an impenetrable Rock, or Barrier of Stone, I rested satisfied, that I should rather find even that yield me a fresh and living Stream, than I should perish for want of it. 
With this easy Mind did I travel five or six Miles on the Side of the Lake, and sometimes stepped into the Wood, and walked a little there, till I had gone almost half the Diameter of the Lake, which lay in a circular, or rather 
[Page 101]
an oval Figure. I had then Thoughts of walking back, to be near my Boat and Lodging, for fear I should be again benighted, if I went much further: But, considering I had come past no Water, and that possibly I might yet find some, if I went quite round the Lake, I rather chose to take up with a new Lodging, that Night, than to return: And I did not want for a Supper; having brought out with me more Bread and Cheese than had serv'd for Dinner, the Remainder of which was in the Lining of my Jacket. When it grew darkish, I had some Thoughts of eating; but I considered, as I was then neither very hungry nor dry, if I should eat, it would but occasion Drought, and I had nothing to allay that with; so I contented myself for that Night, to lay me down Supperless. 
In the Morning, I set forward again, upon my Water search; and hoped to compass the whole Lake that Day. I had gone about seven Miles more, when, at a little Distance before me, I perceived a small Hollow or Cut in the Grass, from the Wood to the Lake; thither I hasted with all speed, and blessed God for the Supply of a fine fresh Rill, which, distilling from several small Clefts in the Rock, had collected itself into one Stream, and cut its Way through the green Sod to the Lake. 

[Page 102]
I lay down with infinite Pleasure, and swallowed a most chearing Draught of the precious Liquid; and sitting on the Brink, made a good Meal of what I had with me, and then drank again. I had now got five sixths of the Lake's Circumference to go back again to my Boat; for I did not suspect any Passage over the Cavern's Mouth, where I came into the Lake; and I could not without much Trouble consider that if I would have this Water for a constant Supply, I must either come a long Way for it, or fix my Habitation near it. I was just going back again, revolving these uneasy Thoughts in my Breast, when this rose suddenly in my Mind, that if I could possibly get over the Mouth of the Cavern, I should not have above three Miles from my Grotto to the Water: Now as I could not get home that Night, otherwise than by crossing it, and as, if I lost my Labour, I should be but where I was; whereas if I should get over, it would very much shorten my Journey; I resolved to try whether the Thing was practicable: First, however, looking out for a resting Place, somewhere near my Water, if I should meet with a Disappointment. 
I then walked into the Wood, where meeting with no Place of Retreat to my liking, I went to my Rill, and taking another Sup, determined not to leave that Side of the Lake, till Morning; but having some Time to spare, I walked 
[Page 103]
about two Miles to view the Inlet of the Lake, and was agreeably surprized, just over the Mouth of the Cavern to see a large stone Arch, like a Bridge, as if it had been cut out of the Rock, quite across the Opening; this cheer'd me vastly, and pushing over it, I found a Path that brought me to my Boat before Night. 
I then went up to my Grotto, for the third Night, in this most delightful Place; and the next Morning early I launched my Boat, and taking my Water Cask, and a small dipping Bucket with me, I rowed away for the Rill, and returned highly pleased with a Sufficiency of Water, whereof I carried a Bucket and a Copper Kettle full up with me to the Grotto. Indeed it was not the least Part of my Satisfaction, that I had this Kettle with me; for though I was in hopes, in my last Voyage, I should have come to some Shore, where I could have landed, and enjoy'd myself over some of my Fish, and for that Reason had taken it, notwithstanding Things did not turn out just as I had schemed, yet my Kettle proved the most useful Piece of Furniture I had. 
Having now acquainted myself with the Circumference of the Lake, and settled a Communication with my Rill, I began to think of commencing Housekeeper. In order thereunto I set about removing my Goods up to the Grotto. By constant Application, in a few 
[Page 104]
Days, I had gotten all thither but my two great Chests and my Water Cask; and how to drag or drive any of those to it, I was entirely at a Loss. My Water Cask was of the utmost Importance to me, and I had Thoughts sometimes of stopping it close, and roling it to the Place; but the Ascent through the Wood to the Grotto was so steep, that, besides the Fear of staving it, which would have been an irreparable Loss, I judged it impossible to accomplish it by my Strength; so, with a good deal of Discontent, I determined to remit both that and the Chests to future Consideration. 
CHAP. XII. 

An Account of the Grotto; a Room added to it; a View of that building; the Author makes a little Cart; also a wet Dock for his Boat; goes in quest of Provision; a Description of divers Fruits and Plants; he brings home a Cart-load of different Sorts; makes Experiments on them; loads his Cart with others; a great Disappointment; makes good Bread; never sees the Sun; the Nature of the Light. 
Having come to a full Resolution of fixing my Residence at the Grotto, and making that my capital Seat, it is proper to give you some Description of it. 

[Page 105]
This Grotto then was a full Mile from the Lake, in the Rock which encompassed the Wood. The Entrance was scarcely two Feet wide, and about nine Feet high, rising, from the Height of seven Feet upward, to a Point in the Middle. The Cavity was about fifteen Feet long within, and about five wide. Being obliged to lye lengthwise in it, full six Feet of it were taken up at the further End for my Lodging only; as nothing could stand on the Side of my Bed that would leave me Room to come at it. The remaining nine Feet of the Cave's Length were taken up, first, by my Fire Place, which was on the deepest Side of the Door-way, ranging with my Bed, (which I had set close to the Rock on one Side) and took up near three Feet in length; and my Furniture and Provisions, of one Sort or other, so filled up the rest, that I had much ado to creep between them into my Bed. 
In the Chest which I had taken for a Seat in the Boat, as aforesaid, upon breaking it open by the Water Side, I found a Mattrass, some Shirts, Shoes, Stockings, and several other useful Things, a small Case of Bottles with Cordials in them, some Instruments of Surgery, Plaisters, and Salves: all which, together with a large Quantity of Fish that I had salted, I carried to the Grotto. 

[Page 106]
My Habitation being thus already over charged, and as I could not however bear the Thoughts of quitting it, or of having any of my Goods exposed to the Weather on the Outside, I was naturally bent on contriving how I should encrease my Accommodations. As I had no Prospect of enlarging the Grotto itself, I could conceive no other Way of effecting my Desire but by the Addition of an outer Room. This Thought pleased me very much, so that the next Day I set myself to plan out the Building, and trace the Foundation of it. 
I told you before, there was about the Space of a Cart-way between the Wood and the Rock clear; but this Breadth, as I was building for Life, (so I imagined) not appearing to me spacious enough for my new Apartment, I considered how I should extend its Bounds into the Wood. Hereupon I set myself to observe what Trees stood at a proper Distance from my Grotto, that might serve as they stood, with a little Management of hewing and the like, to compose a noble Door-way, Posts, and Supporters; and I found, that upon cutting down three of the nearest Trees, I should answer my Purpose in this Respect; and that there were several others, about twenty Feet from the Grotto, and running parallel with the Rock, the Situation of which was so happily adapted to my Intention, that I could make them become, 
[Page 107]
as I fancied, an Out-fence or Wall; so I took my Ax, to cut down my nearest Trees; but as I was going to strike, a somewhat different Scheme presented to my Imagination, that altered my Resolution. 
In Conformity with this new Plan, I fixed the Height of my intended Ceiling, and sawed off my nearest Trees to that, sloping from the Sides to the Middle, to support cross Beams for the Roof to rest on, and left the Trunks standing, by Way of Pillars, both for the Use and Ornament of the Structure. In short, I worked hard every Day upon my Building for a Month; in which Time I had cut all my Timber into proper Lengths for my Out-works and Covering; but was at a great stand, how to fix my side Posts, having no Spade or Mattock, and the Ground almost as hard as flint; for to be sure it had never been stirred since the Creation. I then thought I had the worst Part of my Job to get over; however, I went on; and having contrived, in most of my upright side Quarters, to take the Tops of Trees, and leave on the lower Parts of the Cleft, where they began to branch out and divide from the main Stem, I set one of them upright against the Rock, then laid one End of my long Ceiling-pieces upon the Cleft of it, and laid the other End upon a Tree on the same Side, whose Top I had also sawed off with a proper Cleft; I then 
[Page 108]
went and did the same on the other Side; after this, I laid on a proper Number of cross Beams, and tyed all very firmly together with the Bark of young Trees, stripped off in long Thongs, which answered that purpose very well. Thus I proceeded, crossing, joining, and fastening all together, till the whole Roof was so strong and firm, that there was no stirring any Part of it. I then spread it over with small Lop-wood, on which I raised a Ridge of dried Grass and Weeds, very thick, and thatched over the whole with the Leaves of a Tree very much resembling those of a Palm, but much thicker, and not quite so broad. The entire Surface, I might say, was as smooth as a Dye; and so ordered, by a gentle Declivity every Way, as to carry off the wet. 
Having covered in my Building, I was next to finish and close the Walls of it; the Skeleton of these was compos'd of Sticks, crossing one another checker-wise and tyed together: To fill up the Voids, I wove upon them the longest and most pliable Twigs of the Underwood I could find; leaving only a Door-way on one Side, between two Stems of a Tree, which, dividing in the Trunk, at about two Feet from the Ground, grew from thence, for the rest of its Height, as if the Branches were a Couple of Trees a little distant from one another, which made a Sort of Stile-way to my 
[Page 109]
Room. When this was all done, I temper'd up some Earth by the Lake Side, and mixing it to a due Consistence with Mud, which I took from the Lake, applyed it as a plaistering in this Manner: I divided it into Pieces, which I rolled up of the Size of a Foot-Ball; these Lumps I stuck close by one another on the Lattice, pressing them very hard with my Hands, which forced part of them quite through the small Twigs, and then I smoothed both Sides with the back of my Saw, to about the Thickness of five or six Inches, so that by this Means I had a Wall round my new Apartment a Foot thick. This Plaister-work cost me some Time, and a great deal of Labour, as I had a full Mile to go to the Lake for every Load of Stuff, and could carry but little at once, it was so heavy; but there was neither Water for tempering, or proper Earth to make it with, any nearer. At last, however, I compleated my Building in every Respect but a Door, and for this I was forced to use the Lid of my Sea-Chest, which indeed I would have chosen not to apply that Way, but I had nothing else that would do; and there was however this Conveniency, that it had Hinges ready fixed thereon. 
I now began to enjoy myself in my new Habitation, like the absolute and sole Lord of the Country; for I had neither seen Man nor 
[Page 110]
Beast since my Arrival, save a few Animals in the Trees like our Squirrels, and some Water Rats about the Lake; but there were several strange kinds of Birds, I had never before seen, both on the Lake and in the Woods. 
That which now troubled me most, was, how to get my Water nearer to me than the Lake, for I had no lesser Vessel than the Cask which held above twenty Gallons; and to bring that up was a Fatigue intolerable. My next Contrivance therefore was this: I told you I had taken my Chest-lid to make a Door for my Anti-chamber, as I now began to call it; so I resolved to apply the Body of the Chest also to a Purpose different from that it originally answered. In order to this I went to the Lake where the Body of the Chest lay, and sawed it thorough, within about three Inches of the Bottom; of the two Ends, having rounded them as well as I could, I made two Wheels, and with one of the Sides I made two more; I burnt a Hole through the Middle of each; then preparing two Axle-trees, I fastned them, after setting on the Wheels, to the Bottom of the Chest, with the Nails I had drawn out of it. Having finished this Machine, on which I bestowed no small Labour, I was hugely pleased with it, and only wish'd I had a Beast, if it were but an Ass, to draw it; however, that Task I was 
[Page 111]
satisfied to perform myself, since there was no help for it; so I made a good strong Cord out of my Fishing Lines, and fixed that to drag it by. When all was thus in readiness, filling my Water-Cask, I bound it thereon, and so brought it to the Grotto, with such Ease, comparatively, as quite charmed me. Having succeeded so well in the first Essay, I no sooner unloaded, but down went I again with my Cart, or Truckle rather, to the Lake, and brought from thence on it my other Chest, which I had left entire. 
I had now nothing remaining near the Lake but my Boat, and had half a Mind to try to bring that up too; but having so frequent occasion for her, to get my Water in, which I used in greater abundance now than I had done at first, a great Part going to supply my domestick Uses, as well as for drinking, I resolved against that, and sought out for a convenient Dock to slow it in, as a Preservative against Wind and Weather, which I soon after effected; for having pitched upon a swampy Place, overgrown with a Sort of long Flags or Reeds, I soon cut a Trench from the Lake, with a Sort of Spade or Board that I had chopp'd and sharpen'd for that Use. 
Thus having stowed my Boat, and looked over all my Goods, and sorted them, and taken a Survey of my Provisions, I found I must soon be in want of the last, if I did not forthwith procure a Supply; for though I had victualled 
[Page 112]
so well at setting out, and had been very sparing ever since, yet, had it not been for a great Quantity of Fish I took and salted in my Passage to the Gulph, I had been to seek for Food much sooner. Hereupon, I thought it highly prudent to look out before I really wanted. 
With this Resolution, I accoutred myself, as in my first Walk, with my Instruments and Arms. But instead of travelling the Lake Side, I went along the Wood, and therein found great Plenty of divers kinds of Fruits; though I could scarce persuade myself to taste, or try the Effects of them, being so much unlike our own, or any I had seen elsewhere. I observed amongst the Shrubs abundance of a Fruit, or whatever else you may call it, which grew like a Ram's Horn; sharp at the Point next the Twig it was fastened to, and circling round and round, one Fold upon another, which gradually increased to the Size of my Wrist in the Middle, and then as gradually decreased, till it terminated in a Point again at the contrary Extream; all which Spiral, if it were fairly extended in Length, might be a Yard or an Ell long. I surveyed this strange Vegetable very attentively; it had a Rind, or Crust, which I could not break with my Hand; but taking my Knife, and making an opening therewith in the Shell, there issued out a Sort of milky Liquor in great Quantity, to at least a Pint and half, which, having tasted, I found 
[Page 113]
as sweet as Honey, and very pleasant. However, I could not perswade myself any more than just to taste it. I then found on the large Trees several Kinds of Fruits, like Pears or Quinces, but most of them exceeding hard and rough, and quite disagreeable: so I quitted my Hopes of them. 
About three Miles from my Grotto, I met with a large Space of Ground full of a low Plant, growing only with a single woody Stalk half a Foot high, and from thence issued a round Head, about a Foot or ten Inches Diameter, but quite flat, about three Quarters of an Inch thick, and just like a Cream Cheese, standing upon its Edge. These grew so close together, that, upon the least Wind stirring, their Heads rattled against each other very musically; for tho' the Stalks were so very strong, that they would not easily either bend or break, yet the fanning of the Wind upon the broad Heads twisting the Stalks, so as to let the Heads strike each other, they made a most agreeable Sound. 
I stood some time admiring this Shrub, and then cutting up one of them, I found it weighed about two Pounds; they had a tough green Rind or Covering, very smooth, and the Inside full of a stringy Pulp, quite white. In short, I made divers other Trials of Berries, Roots, Herbs, and what else I could find, but received 
[Page 114]
little Satisfaction from any of them, for fear of bad Qualities. I returned back ruminating on what Things I had seen, resolving to take my Cart the next Walk, and bring it home loaded with different kinds of them, in order to make my Trials thereof at Leisure. But my Cart being too flat, and wanting Sides, I considered it would carry very little, and that what it would otherwise bear, on that account, must tumble and roll off; so I made a Fire, and turned Smith; for with great to do, breaking off the Wards of a large Key I had, and making it red hot, I by Degrees fashioned it into a kind of Spindle, and therewith making Holes quite round the Bottom of my Cart, in them I stuck up Sticks, about two Feet high, that I had taper'd at the End to fit them. 
Having thus qualified my Cart for a Load, I proceeded with it to the Wood, and cutting a small Quantity of each Species of Green, Berry, Fruit, and Flower, that I could find, and packing them severally in Parcels, I returned at Night heavy laden, and held a Council with myself, what Use they could most properly be applied to. 
I had amongst my Goods, as I said, a Copper Kettle, which held about a Gallon; this I set over my Fire, and boiled something by Turns of every Sort in it, watching all the while, and with a Stick stiring and raising up 
[Page 115]
one Thing and then another, to feel when they were boiled tender; but of upwards of twenty Greens which I thus dressed, only one proved eatable, all the rest becoming more stringy, tough, and insipid, for the cooking. The one I have excepted, was a round, thick, woolly leased Plant, which boiled tender, and tasted as well as Spinage; I therefore preserved some Leaves of this, to know it again by, and, for Distinction, called it by the Name of that Herb. 
I then began upon my Fruits, of the Pear and Quince kind, at least eight different Sorts, but I found I could make nothing of them, for they were most of them as rough and crabbed after stewing as before; so I laid them all aside. Lastly, I boiled my Ram's-horn and Cream-cheese, as I called them, together. Upon tasting the latter of these, it was become so watery and insipid, I laid it aside as useless. I then cut the other, and tasted the Juice, which proved so exceedingly pleasant, that I took a large Gulp or two of it, and tossed it into the Kettle again. 
Having now gone through the several kinds of my Exoticks, I had a Mind to re-examine them after cooling; but could make nothing of any of my Greens but the Spinage. I tried several Berries and Nuts too; but, save a few Sorts of Nuts, they were all very tasteless. Then I began to review the Fruits, and could find but 
[Page 116]
two Sorts, that I had any the least hopes from. I then laid the best by, and threw the others away. After this Process, which took me up near a whole Day, and clearing my House of Good-for-nothings, I returned to re-examine my Cheese, that was grown cold, and was now so dry and hard I could not get my Teeth into it; upon which I was going to skim it away out of my Grotto, saying, go thou worthless, (for I always spoke aloud my Thoughts to myself): I say, I was just dispatching it, when I check'd my Hand, and, as I could make no Impression with my Teeth, had a mind to try what my Knife could do. Accordingly I began at the Edge of the Quarter, for I had boiled but a Quarter of it; but the Rind was grown so hard and brittle, that my Knife slipping, and raking along the cut Edge of it, scratched off some Powder as white as possible; I then scraped it backward and forward some time, till I found it would all scrape away in this Powder, except the Rind; upon which I laid it aside again for further Experiment. 
During this Review my Kettle and Ram's-horn had been boiling, till hearing it blubber very loud, and seeing there was but little Liquor in it, I whipped it off the Fire, for Fear of burning its Bottom, but took no further notice of it, till about two Hours after; when returning to the Grotto, I went to wash out my Kettle, 
[Page 117]
but could scarce got my Ram's-horn from the Bottom; and when I did, it brought up with it a Sort of pitchy Substance, though not so black, and several gummy Threads hanging to it, drawn out to a great Length. I wondered at this, and thought the Shell of the Ram's-horn had melted, or some such Thing; 'till venturing to put a little of the Stuff on my Tongue, it proved, to my thinking, as good Treacle as I had ever tasted. 
This new Discovery pleased me very much. I scraped all the sweet Thing up, and laid it near my Grotto, in a large Leaf of one of the Trees, (about two Feet long, and broad in Proportion) to prevent its running about. In getting this Curiosity out of my Kettle, I found in it a small Piece of my Cheese, which I suppose had been broke off in stirring; and biting it, for it was soft enough, I think it was the most luscious and delicate Morsel I ever put into my Lips. This unexpected good Fortune put me on trying the best of my Pears again; so setting on my Kettle, with very little Water, and putting some of my Treacle into it, and two of the best Pears quarter'd, I found, upon a little boiling, they also became an excellent Dainty. 
Having succeeded so well, I was quite ripe for another Journey with my Cart: which I accordingly undertook, taking my Rout over the Stone Bridge, to see what the other Side of the Lake produced. In travelling thro' the Trees, I met, amongst 
[Page 118]
other Things, with abundance of large Gourds, which, climbing the Trees, displayed their Fruit to the Height of twenty or thirty Feet above the Ground. I cut a great many of these, and some very large ones, of different Hues and Forms; which, of themselves, making a great Load, with some few new Sorts of Berries and Greens, was the gathering of that Day. But I must tell you, I was almost foiled in getting them home; for coming to my Stone-bride, it rose so steep, and was so much ruggeder than the Grass or Wood-ground, that I was at a Set upon the first Entrance, and terribly afraid I should either break my Wheels, or pull of my Axle-trees. Hereupon, I was forced to unload, and carry my Cargoe over in my Arms to the other Side of the Bridge; whither having then, with less Fear but much Caution, drawn my Cart, I loaded again, and got safe home. 
I was mightily pleased with the Acquisitions of this Journey, for now, thinks I, I shall have several convenient Family Utensils; so spent the next Day or two in scooping my Gourds and cleaning away the Pulp. When I had done this, finding the Rinds to be very weak and yielding, I made a good Fire, and setting them round it at a moderate Distance, to dry, I went about something else without Doors. But alass my Hopes were ill founded; for coming home to turn my Gourds, and see how dry they were, 
[Page 119]
I found them all warp'd, and turn'd into a Variety of uncouth Shapes. This put me to a stand; but however, I recovered some Pieces of them for use, as the bottom Parts of most of them, after paring away the Sides, would hold something, though they by no Means answered my first Purpose. 
Well, thinks I, what if I have lost my Gourds, I have gained Experience; I will dry them next Time with the Guts in, and having stiffened their Rinds, in their proper Dimensions, then try to cleanse them. So next Morning, for I was very eager at it, I set out with my Cart for another Load; and having handed them over the Bridge, got safe with them to the Grotto. These by proper Management proved exceedingly valuable to me, answering, in one Way or other, the several Uses of Plates, Bottles, Pans, and divers other Vessels. 
I now got a large Quantity of the vegetable Ram's-horn, and filled a great many of my Gourds with the Treacle it yielded; I also boiled and dried a large Parcel of my Cheeses, and hung them up for Use: For I had now for some Time made all my Bread of the latter, scraping and bruising the Flower, and mixing it with my Treacle and Water; and this, indeed, made such a sweet and nourishing Bread, that I could even have lived wholly upon it: But I afterwards very much improved it, by 
[Page 120]
putting the milky Juice of the Ram's-horn, unboiled, to my Flower, in a small Quantity, and then baking it on the Hearth, covered over with Embers: This detracted nothing from the Sweetness and Mellowness of my Bread, but made it much lighter than the Treacle alone would have done. 
Finding there was no Fear of starving, but so far from it, that from Day to Day I found out something new to add to my Repasts, either in Substantials, or by Way of Desert, I set me down very well contented with my Condition. I had nothing to do, but to lay up Store against Sickness, and the dark Weather; which last I expected would soon be upon me, as the Days were now exceeding short. Indeed, tho' I had new been here six Months, I had never seen the Sun since I first entered the Gulph; and tho' there was very little Rain, and but few Clouds, yet the brightest Day-light never exceeded that of half an Hour after Sunset, in the Summertime in England, and little more than just redned the Sky. For the first part of my Time here, there was but little if any Difference between Day and Night; but afterwards, what I might call the Night, or lesser Degree of Light, took up more Hours than the greater, and went on gradually encreasing as to Time, so that I perceived total Darkness approached, such as I had on board my Ship the Year before. 

[Page 121]

CHAP. XIII. 

The Author lays in a Store against the dark Weather; hears Voices; his Thoughts thereon; persuades himself it was a Dream; hears them again; determines to see if any one lodged in the Rock; is satisfied there is nobody; Observations on what he saw; finds a strong Weed like Whipcord; makes a drag Net, lengthens it; catches a Monster; its Description; makes Oil of it. 
I had now well stored my Grotto with all Sorts of Winter Provisions; and feeling the Weather grow very cold, I expected, and waited patiently for, the total Darkness. I went little abroad, and employed myself within Doors, endeavouring to fence against the approaching Extremity of the Cold. For this Purpose, I prepared a Quantity of Rushes; which being very dry, I spread them smoothly on the Floor of my Bed-chamber a good Thickness, and over them I laid my Matrass. Then, I made a double Sheet of the Boat's Awning, or Sail, that I had brought to cover my Goods; and having scewered together several of the Jackets and Cloaths I found in the Chest, of them I made a Coverlid; so that I lay very commodiously, and made very long Nights of it, now the dark Season was set in. 

[Page 122]
As I lay awake one Night, or Day, I know not whether, I very plainly heard the Sound of several human Voices, and sometimes very loud; but tho' I could easily distinguish the Articulations, I could not understand the least Word that was said; nor did the Voices seem at all to me like such as I had any where heard before, but much softer and more musical. This startled me, and I rose immediately, slipping on my Cloaths, and taking my Gun in my Hand, (which I always kept charged, being my constant travelling Companion) and my Cutlass. Thus equipp'd, I walked into my Anti-chamber, where I heard the Voices much plainer, till, after some little Time, they by Degrees died quite away. After watching here and hearkening a good while, hearing nothing, I walked back into the Grotto, and laid me down again on my Bed. I was inclin'd to open the Door of my Anti-chamber, but I own I was afraid; beside, I considered, that if I did, I could discover nothing at any Distance, by reason of the thick and gloomy Wood that inclosed me. 
I had a thousand different Surmises about the Meaning of this odd Incident; and could not conceive how any humane Creature should be in my Kingdom (as I called it) but myself, and I never yet see them, or any Trace of their Habitation. But then again I reflected, that though I had surrounded 
[Page 123]
the whole Lake, yet I had not traced the out Bounds of the Wood, next the Rock, where there might be innumerable Grotto's like mine; nay perhaps some as spacious as that I had sailed through to the Lake; and that though I had not perceived it yet, this beautiful Spot might be very well peopled. But, says I again, if there be any such Beings as I am fancying here, surely they don't skulk in their Dens, like savage Beasts, by Day-light, and only patrole for Prey by Night; if so, I shall probably become a delicious Morsel for them e're long, if they meet with me. This kept me still more within Doors than before, and I hardly ever stirred out but for Water, or Firing. At length, hearing no more Voices, or seeing any one, I began to be more composed in my Mind, and at last grew persuaded, it was all a meer Delusion, and only a Fancy of mine, without any real Foundation; and sometimes, though I was sure I was fully awake when I heard them, I persuaded myself I had rose in my Sleep, upon a Dream of Voices; and recollected with myself the various Stories I had heard, when a Boy, of walking in one's Sleep, and the surprising Effects of it; so the whole Notion was now blown over. 
I had not enjoy'd my Tranquillity above a Week, before my Fears were roused afresh, hearing the same Sound of Voices, twice the 
[Page 124]
same Night; but not many Minutes at a Time. What gave me most Pain, was, that they were at such a Distance, as I judged by the Languor of the Sound, that if I had opened my Door, I could not have seen the Utterers through the Trees, and I was resolved not to venture out; but then I determined, if they should come again, any thing near my Grotto, to open the Door, see who they were, and stand upon my Defence, whatever came of it: For, says I, my Entrance is so narrow and high, that more than one can't come at a time; and I can with Ease dispatch twenty of them before they can secure me, if they should be Savages; but if they prove sensible humane Creatures, it will be a great Benefit to me, to join myself to their Society. Thus had I formed my Scheme, but I heard no more of them, for a great while; so that at length beginning to grow ashamed of my Fears, I became tranquil again. 
The Day now returning, and with it my Labours, I applied to my usual Callings; but my Mind run strangely upon viewing the Rock quite round, that is, the whole Circuit of my Dominions: for, thinks I, there may possibly be an Outlet through the Rock into some other Country, from whence the Persons I heard may come. As soon therefore as the Days grew towards the longest, I prepared for my Progress. Having lived so well at home since my Settlement, I did 
[Page 125]
not care to trust only to what I could pick up in the Woods, for my Subsistance during this Journey, which would not only take up Time in procuring, but perhaps not agree with me; so I resolved to carry a Supply with me, proportionate to the Length of my Perambulation. Hereupon considering, that though my Walk round the Lake was finished in two Days, yet as I now intended to go round by the Rock, the Way would be much longer, and perhaps more troublesome than that was; remembering also my Journey with Glanlipze in Africa, and how much I complained of the Fruits we carried for our Subsistance; these Circumstances, I say, laying together, I resolved to load the Cart with a Variety of Food, Bread and Fruits especially, and draw that with me. 
Thus provided I sallied forth with great Chearfulness, and proceded in the main easily; though in some Places I was forced to make Way with my Hatchet, the Ground was so overrun with Underwood. I very narrowly view'd the Rock as I went, Bottom and Sides, all the Way, but could see nothing like a Passage through it; or indeed any more than one Opening, or Inlet, which I enter'd for about thirty Yards; but it was not above three Feet wide, and terminated in the solid Rock. 
After some Days travel, (making all the Observations I could on the several Plants, Shrubs, and 
[Page 126]
Trees, which I met with, particularly, where any of these occurr'd to me entirely new) finding myself a little faintish, I had a mind for a Sup of Ram's-horn Juice; so I cut me one; but, upon opening it, found therein only a pithy Pulp, and no Ways fit to taste. I supposed by this, I was too early for the Milk; it being three Months later, the last Year, when I cut them. Hereon, seeing one upon another Shrub, which, by its rusty Colour, I judged might have hung all the Winter, I opened that, and found it full of Milk; but, putting some of it into my Mouth, it was as four as any Vinegar I ever tasted in my Life. So, thinks I, and said so too, for, as I told you before, I always spoke out; here's Sauce for something when I want it: and this gave me a Hint to store myself with these Gourds, to hang by for Vinegar the next Winter. 
By this Time I had come almost to my Rill; when I enter'd upon a large Plat of Ground, miserably over-run with Weeds, matted together very thick. These choaked up my Wheels in such a Manner, that I could neither free them with my Hands, or get either backwards or forwards, they binding my Cart down like so many Cords; so that I was oblig'd to cut my Way back again, with my Hatchet, and take a sweep round in the Wood, on the Outside of these Weeds. 

[Page 127]
In all my Life I never saw any Thing of its Size, for it was not thicker than a Whipcord, so strong as this Weed; and what raised my Wonder, was the Length of it, for I drew out Pieces of it near fifty Foot long; and even they were broken at the End, so that it might be as long again for ought I know; for it was so matted, and twisted together, that it was a great Trial of Patience to untangle it; but that which was driest, and to me looked the rottenest and weakest, I found to be much the strongest. Upon Examination of its Parts, I discover'd it to be composed of an infinite Number of small Threads, spirally overlaying and infolding one another. 
As I saw but few Things that I could not find a use for, so this I perceived would serve all the common Purposes of Packthread; a Thing I was often in want of. This inclined me to take a Load of it home with me. Indeed the Difficulty of getting a Quantity in the Condition I desired it puzzled me a little; for, says I, if I cut up a good deal of it with my Hatchet, as I first design'd, I shall only have small Lengths, good for little, and to get it in Pieces of any considerable Length, so as to be of Service, will require much Time and Labour; but reflecting how much I needed it, and of what Benefit it would be, I resolved to make a Trial of what I could do. So, without more Hesitation, I went to Work, and cutting a Fibre close 
[Page 128]
to its Root, I extricated that Thread from all its Windings, just as one does an entangled Whipcord. When I had thus disengaged a sufficient Length, I cut that off; and repeating the like Operation, in about three Hour's Time, but with no little Toil, I made up my Load of different Lengths, just to my liking. Having finished this Task, I filled the Gourd, brought for that Purpose, with Water; and having first viewed the whole remaining Part of the Rock, I returned over the Stone Bridge home again. 
This Journey, though it took me up several Days, and was attended with some Fatigue, had yet given me great Satisfaction; for now I was persuaded I could not have one Rival, or Enemy, to fear in my whole Dominions. And from the Impossibility, as I suppos'd, of there being any, or of the Ingress of any, unless by the same Passage I enter'd at, and by which I was well assured they could never return, I grew contented; and blamed myself for the Folly of my imaginary Voices, as I called them then, and took it for a Distemper of the Fancy only. 
The next Day I looked over my Load of Matweed, having given it that Name, and separated the different Lengths from each other. I then found I had several Peices between forty and fifty Feet long, of which I resolved to get a good Number more, to make me a Drag-net, that 
[Page 129]
I might try for some Fish in the Lake. A Day or two after, therefore, I brought home another Load of it. Then I picked out a smooth level Spot upon the green Swarth, and having prepared a great Number of short wooden Pegs, I strained a Line of the Matweed, about ten Feet long, tying it at each End to a Peg, and struck a Row of Pegs along by that Line, about two Inches asunder; I next strained another Line, of the same Length, parallel to that, at the Distance of forty Feet from it, and struck Pegs thereby, corresponding to the former Row; and from each Peg on one Side, to the opposite Peg on the other, I tied a like Length of my Matline, quite through the whole Number of Pegs; when the Work looked like the Inside of an Harpsichord; I afterwards drove Pegs, in like Manner, along the whole Length of the two outermost longer Lines, and tied shorter Lines to them; so that the whole Affair then represented the Squares of a Racket; the Corners of each of which Squares, I tied very tight with smaller Pieces of the Line, till I had formed a compleat Net of forty Feet long and ten wide. 
When I had finished my Net, as I thought, I wrapped several Stones in Rags, and fastened them to the Bottom to sink it, and some of the smallest, unscooped, dry Gourds to the Top, to keep that Part boyant. I now longed to begin my new Trade, and carried the Net 
[Page 130]
to my Boat, with that Intention; but, after two or three Hauls, I found it would not answer for want of Length; (though, by Chance, I caught a blackish Fish without Scales, a little bigger than a Whiting, but much longer, which stuck by the Gills in it;) so I left the Net in the Boat, resolving to make an Addition to it with all Speed, and returning to my Grotto, I supped on the Fish I had taken, and considered how to pursue my Enterprize with better Effect. 
I provided me with another large Parcel of Line; and having brought two more Lengths to Perfection, I joined all together, and fixing one End on Shore, by a Pole I had cut for that Purpose, I launched my Boat, with the other End in it, taking a Sweep the Length of my Net, round to my Stick again; and getting on Shore, hauled up my Net, by both Ends together. I found now I had mended my Instrument, and taken a proper Way of applying it; for by this Means, in five Hauls, I caught about sixteen Fish, of three or four different Sorts, and one Shell-fish, almost like a Lobster, but without great Claws, and with a very small short Tail: which made me think, as the Body was thrice as long as a Lobster's in Proportion, that it did not swim backwards, like that Creature, but only crawled forwards, (it having Lobster-like 
[Page 131]
Legs, but much shorter and stronger) and that the Legs all standing so forward, its Tail was, by its Motion, to keep the hinder Part of the Body from dragging upon the Ground, as I observed it did when the Creature walked on Land; it then frequently flacking its short Tail. 
These Fish made me rich in Provisions. Some of them I eat fresh, and the remainder I falted down. But of all the kinds, my Lobster was the most delicious Food, and made me almost three Meals. 
Thus finding there were Fish to be had, tho' my present Tackle seemed suitable enough to my Family, yet could I not rest, till I had improved my Fishery, by inlarging my Net: For, as it was, even with my late Addition, I must either sweep little or no Compass of Ground, or it would have no Bag behind me. Upon this I set to work, and shortly doubled the Dimensions of it. I had then a Mind to try it at the Mouth of my Rill; so taking it with me the next Time I crossed the Lake for Water, and fastening it to my Pole, close by the right Side of the Rill, I swept along Compass round to the left, and closing the Ends, attempted to draw up in the hollow Cut of the Rill. But by the Time I had gathered up two thirds of the Net, I felt a Resistance that quite amazed me. In short, I was not able to stand against the Force I felt. Whereupon, sitting down in the Rill, 
[Page 132]
and clapping my Feet to the two Sides of it, I exerted all my Strength, till finally I became Conqueror, and brought up so shocking a Monster, that I was just rising to run for my Life on the Sight of it. But recollecting that the Creature was hampered, and could not make so much Resistance on the Land as in the Water, I ventured to drag the Net up as far from the Rill as my Strength and Breath would permit me; and then running to the Boat for my Gun, I returned to the Net, to examine my Prize. Indeed I had not instantly Resolution enough to survey it; and when at length I assumed Courage enough to do so, I could not perfectly distinguish the Parts, they were so discomposed; but taking hold of one End of the Net I endeavoured to disentangle the Thing, and then drawing the Net away, a most surprising Sight presented itself: The Creature reared upright, about three Feet high, covered all over with long black shaggy Hair, like a Bear, which hung down from his Head and Neck quite along his Back and Sides. He had two Fins, very broad and large, which, as he stood erect, looked like Arms, and those he waved and whirled about with incredible Velocity; and though I wondered at first at it, I found afterwards, it was the Motion of these Fins that kept him upright; for I perceived when they ceased their Motion, he fell flat on his Belly. He had two 
[Page 133]
very large Feet, which he stood upon, but could not run, and but barely walk on them; which made me in the less haste to dispatch him; and after he had stood upon his Feet about four Minutes, clapping his Fins to his Sides, he fell upon his Belly. 
When I found he could not attack me, I was moving closer to him; but, upon sight of my stirring, up he rose again, and whirled his Fins about as before, so long as he stood. And now I view'd him round, and found he had no Tail at all; and that his hinder Fins, or Feet, very much resembled a large Frog's, but were at least ten Inches broad, and eighteen long, from Heel to Toe; and his Legs were so short, that when he stood upright, his Breech bore upon the Ground. His Belly, which he kept towards me, was of an Ash-colour, and very broad, as was also his Breast. His Eyes were small and blue, with a large black Sight in the Middle, and rather of an oval than round make. He had a long Snout like a Boar, and vast Teeth. Thus having survey'd him near half an Hour living, I made him rise up once more, and shot him in the Breast. He fell, and giving a loud Howl, or Groan, expired. 
I had then Time to see what else I had caught; and turning over the Net, found a few of the same Fish I had taken before, and some others of a flattish make, and one little Lump of Flesh unform'd: 
[Page 134]
which last, by all I could make of it, seemed to be either a Spawn or young one of that I had shot. 
The great Creature was so heavy, I was afraid I must have cut him in Pieces to get him to the Boat: but with much ado, having stowed the rest, I tumbled him on board. I then filled my Water-cask, and rowed homewards. Being got to Land, I was obliged to bring down my Cart, to carry my great Beast Fish, as I termed him, up to the Grotto. When I had got him thither, I had a Notion of first tasting, and then, if I liked his Flesh, of salting him down, and drying him; so, having flead him, and taken out the Guts and Intrails, I broiled a Piece of him; but it made such a Blaze, that most of the Fat run into the Fire, and the Flesh prov'd so dry and rank, that I could no Ways endure it. 
I then began to be sorry I had taken so much Pains for no Profit, and had endangered my Net into the Bargain, (for that had got a Crack or two in the Scuffle) and was thinking to throw away my large, but worthless, Acquisition. However, as I was now prone to weighing all Things, before I threw it away, I resolved to consider a little; whereupon I changed my Mind. Says I, here is a good warm Skin, which, when dry, will make me a rare Cushion. Again, I have for a long while had no Light beside that of the Day; but now, as this Beast's Fat makes such a Blaze in the Fire, and issues in so great a 
[Page 135]
Quantity from such a small Piece as I broiled, why may not I boil a good Tallow or Oil out of it? and if I can, I have not made so bad a Hand of my Time as I thought for. 
In short, I went immediately to work upon this Subject, (for I never let a Project cool after I had once started it) and boiled as much of the Flesh as my Kettle would hold; and letting it stand to cool, I found it turned out a very good Oil for burning; though, I confess, I thought it would rather have made Tallow. This Success quickened my Industry; and I repeated the Operation, till I got about ten Quarts of this Stuff, which very well rewarded my Labour. After I had extracted as much Oil as I could from the Beast Fish, the Creature having strongly impress'd my Imagination, I conceived a new Fancy in relation to it; and that was, having heard him make a deep howling Groan at his Death, I endeavoured to perswade myself, and at last verily believed, that tho Voices I had so often heard, in the dark Weather, proceeded from Numbers of these Creatures, diverting themselves in the Lake, or sporting together on the Shore: And this Thought, in its Turn, contributed to ease my Apprehensions in that Respect.

CHAP. XIV. 

The Author passes the Summer pleasantly; hears the Voices in the Winter; ventures out; sees a strange Sight on the Lake; his Uneasiness at it; his Dream; Soliloquy; hears the Voices again, and perceives a great Shock on his Building; takes up a beautiful Woman; he thinks her dead, but recovers her; a Description of her; she stays with him. 
I passed the Summer, (tho' I had never yet seen the Sun's Body) very much to my Satisfaction: partly, in the Work I have been describing, (for I had taken two more of the Beast Fish, and had a great quantity of Oil from'em;) partly, in building me a Chimney in my Antichamber, of Mud and Earth burnt on my own Hearth into a sort of Brick; in making a Window at one End of the above-said Chamber, to let in what little Light would come through the Trees, when I did not choose to open my Door; in moulding an earthen Lamp for my Oil; and, finally, in providing and laying in Stores, fresh and salt, (for I had now cured and dryed many more Fish) against Winter. These, I say, were my Summer Employments, at Home, intermix'd with many agreeable Excursions. But now, the Winter coming on, and the Days growing very short, or indeed there being no Day, properly speaking, but a kind of Twilight, 
[Page 137]
I kept mostly in my Habitation: tho' not so much as I had done the Winter before, when I had no light within Doors, and slept, or at least lay still, great part of my Time; for now my Lamp was never out. I also turned two of my Beast-fish Skins into a Rugg to cover my Bed, and the third into a Cushion, which I always sat upon, and a very soft and warm Cushion it made. All this together rendered my life very easy, yea even comfortable. 
An indifferent Person would now be apt to ask, what would this Man desire more than he had? To this I answer, that I was contented, while my Condition was such as I have been describing; but a little while after the Darkness, or Twilight, came on, I frequently heard the Voices again; sometimes a few only at a time, as it seem'd, and then again in great Numbers. This threw me into new Fears, and I became as uneasy as ever, even to the degree of growing quite Melancholly; tho', otherwise, I never received the least Injury from any thing. I foolishly attempted several Times, by looking out at my Window, to discover what these odd Sounds proceeded from; tho' I knew it was too dark to see any thing there. 
I was now fully convinc'd, by a more deliberate Attention to 'em, that they could not be uttered by the Beast-fish, as I had afore conjectured, but only by Beings capable of articulate 
[Page 138]
Speech: But then, what, or where they were, it galled me to be ignorant of. 
At length one Night or Day, I can't say which, hearing the Voices very distinctly, and praying very earnestly, to be either delivered from the uncertainty they had put me under, or to have them removed from me, I took Courage, and arming myself with Gun, Pistols, and Cutlass, I went out of my Grotto, and crept down the Wood. I then heard them plainer than before, and was able to judge from what Point of the Compass they proceeded. Hereupon I went forward towards the Sound, till I came to the Verge of the Wood, where I could see the Lake very well by the dazzle of the Water. Thereon, as I thought, I beheld a Fleet of Boats, covering a large Compass, and not far from the Bridge. I was shock'd hereat beyond Expression. I could not conceive where they came from, or whither they would go; but supposed there must be some other Passage to the Lake, than I had found in my Voyage thro' the Cavern, and that for certain they came that Way, and from some Place, of which, as yet, I had no manner of Knowledge. 
Whilst I was entertaining myself with this Speculation, I heard the People in the Boats laughing and talking very merrily; tho' I was too distant to distinguish the Words. I discern'd soon after all the Boats (as I still supposed 'em) 
[Page 139]
draw up, and push for the Bridge; presently after, tho' I was sure no Boat entered the Arch, I saw a Multitude of People, on the opposite Shore, all marching towards the Bridge; and what was the strangest of all, there was not the least Sign of a Boat now left upon the whole Lake. I then was in a greater Consternation than before; but was still much more so, when I saw the whole Posse of People, that as I have just said were marching towards the Bridge, coming over it to my side of the Lake. At this my Heart failed, and I was just going to run to my Grotto for Shelter; but taking one look more, I plainly discovered, that the People, leaping one after another from the Top of the Bridge, as if into the Water, and then rising again, flew in a long Train over the Lake, the length ways of it, quite out of my Sight, laughing, hollowing and sporting together: so that looking back again to the Bridge, and on the Lake, I could neither see Person, Boat, or any thing else, nor hear the least Noise or Stir afterwards for that Time. 
I returned to my Grotto brim full of this amazing Adventure; bemoaning my Misfortune, in being at a Place, where I was like to remain ignorant of what was doing about me. For says I, if I am in a Land of Spirits, as now I have little room to doubt, there is no guarding against them. I am never safe, even in my Grotto; for that can be no Security against such Beings as 
[Page 140]
can sail on the Water in no Boats, and fly in the Air on no Wings, as the Case now appears to me, who can be here and there, and wherever they please. What a miserable State, I say, am I fallen to? I should have been glad to have had human Converse, and to have found Inhabitants in this Place; but there being none, as I supposed hitherto, I contented myself with thinking, I was at least safe from all those Evils, Mankind, in Society, are obnoxious to: But now, what may be the Consequence of the next Hour I know not; nay, I am not able to say, but whilst I speak, and show my Discontent, they may at a distance conceive my Thoughts, and be hatching Revenge against me for my dislike of them. 
The Pressure of my Spirits inclining me to repose, I laid me down, but could get no rest; nor could all my most serious Thoughts, even of the Almighty Providence, give me relief under my present Anxiety: And all this was only from my State of Uncertainty, concerning the reality of what I had heard and seen; and from the Earnestness with which I coveted a satisfactory Knowledge of those Beings who had just taken their Flight from me. 
I really believe, the fiercest wild Beast, or the most savage of Mankind that had met me, and put me upon my Defence, would not have given me half the trouble that then lay upon me; and the more, for that I had no seeming Possibility 
[Page 141]
of ever being rid of my Apprehensions: So, finding I could not sleep, I got up again; but as I could not fly from myself, all the Art I could use with myself, was but in vain to obtain me any Quiet. 
In the Height of my Distress I had recourse to Prayer, with no small Benefit; begging, that if it pleased not the Almighty Power to remove the Object of my Fears, at least to resolve my Doubts about them, and to render them rather helpful than hurtful to me. I hereupon, as I always did on such Occasions, found myself much more placid and easy, and began to hope the best, 'till I had almost perswaded myself that I was out of Danger; and then laying myself down, I rested very sweetly, 'till I was wakened by the Impulse of the following Dream. 
Methought I was in Cornwall, at my Wife's Aunt's; and enquiring after her and my Children, the old Gentlewoman inform'd me, both my Wife and Children had been dead some time, and that my Wife, before her Departure, desired her (that is her Aunt) immediately upon my Arrival to tell me, she was only gone to the Lake, where I should be sure to see her, and be happy with her ever after. I then, as I fancied, ran to the Lake, to find her. In my Passage she stopped me, crying, whither so fast Peter? I am your Wife, your Patty. Methought I did not know her, she was so altered; but observing her 
[Page 142]
Voice, and looking more wistfully at her, she appeared to me, as the most beautiful Creature I ever beheld. I then went to seize her in my Arms; but the hurry of my Spirits awakened me. 
When I got up, I kept at home, not caring even to look out at my Door. My Dream ran strangely in my Head, and I had now nothing but Patty in my Mind. Oh! cries I, how happy could I be with her, though I had only her in this Solitude. Oh! that this was but a Reality, and not a Dream. And indeed, though it was but a Dream, I could scarce refrain from running to the Lake to meet my Patty. But then I checked my Folly, and reasoned myself into some Degree of Temper again. However, I could not forbear crying out, What! nobody to converse with, nobody to assist, comfort, or counsel me! this is a melancholly Situation indeed. Thus I run on lamenting, till I was almost weary; when, on a sudden, I again heard the Voices. Hark! says I, here they come again. Well, I am now resolved to face them; come Life, come Death. It is not to be alone I thus dread; but to have Company about me, and not know who or what; is Death to me, worse than I can suffer from them, be they who, or what they will. 
During my Soliloquy the Voices increased, and then by Degrees diminished as usual; but I 
[Page 143]
had scarce got my Gun in my Hand, to pursue my Resolution of shewing myself to those who uttered them, when I felt such a Thump upon the Roof of my Antichamber, as shook the whole Fabrick, and set me all over into a Tremor; I then heard a sort of Shriek, and a Rustle near the Door of my Apartment: all which together seemed very terrible. But I, having before determined to see what, and who it was, resolutely opened my Door and leaped out. I saw nobody; all was quite silent, and nothing that I could perceive but my own Fears a moving. I went then softly to the Corner of the Building, and there looking down by the Glimmer of my Lamp, which stood in the Window, I saw something in human Shape lying at my Feet. I gave the Word, who's there? Still no one answered. My Heart was ready to force a Way through my Side. I was for a while fix'd to the Earth like a Statue. At length, recovering, I stepped in, fetched my Lamp, and returning, saw the very beautiful Face my Patty appeared under in my Dream; and not considering that it was only a Dream, I verily thought I had my Patty before me, but she seemed to be stone dead. Upon viewing her other Parts, for I had never yet removed my Eyes from her Face, I found she had a sort of brown Chaplet, like Lace, round her Head, under and about which her Hair was tucked up and twined; and she seemed to me 
[Page 144]
to be cloathed in a thin hair-coloured silk Garment; which, upon trying to raise her, I found to be quite warm, and therefore hoped there was Life in the Body it contained. I then took her into my Arms, and treading a Step backwards with her, I put out my Lamp; however, having her in my Arms, I conveyed her through the Door-way in the dark, into my Grotto; here I laid her upon my Bed, and then run out for my Lamp. 
This, thinks I, is an amazing Adventure. How could Patty come here, and drest in Silk and Whalebone too? sure that is not the reigning Fashion in England now? But my Dream said she was dead. Why truly, says I, so she seems to be. But be it so, she is warm. Whether this is the Place for Persons to inhabit after Death or not, I can't tell, (for I see there are People here, though I don't know them;) but be it as it will, she feels as Flesh and Blood; and if I can but bring her to stir and act again as my Wife, what matters it to me, what she is; it will be a great Blessing and Comfort to me; for she never would have come to this very Spot, but for my good. 
Top-full of these Thoughts, I re-entered my Grotto, shut my Door, and lighted my Lamp; when going to my Patty, (as I delighted to fancy her) I thought I saw her Eyes stir a little. I then set the Lamp farther off, for Fear offending 
[Page 145]
them if she should look up; and warming the last Glass I had reserved of my Madeira, I carried it to her, but she never stirred. I now supposed the Fall had absolutely killed her, and was prodigiously griev'd, when laying my Hand on her Breast, I perceived the Fountain of Life had some Motion. This gave me infinite Pleasure; so, not despairing, I dipped my Finger in the Wine, and moistened her Lips with it two or three Times; and I imagined they opened a little. Upon this I bethought me, and taking a Tea-spoon, I gently poured a few Drops of the Wine by that Means into her Mouth. Finding she swallowed it, I poured in another Spoonful, and another, till I brought her to herself, so well as to be able to sit up. All this I did by a glimmering Light, which the Lamp afforded from a distant Part of the Room, where I had placed it, as I have said, out of her Sight. 
I then spoke to her, and asked divers Questions, as if she had really been Patty, and understood me; in return of which, she uttered a Language I had no Idea of, though in the most musical Tone, and with the sweetest Accent I ever heard. It grieved me I could not understand her. However, thinking she might like to be upon her Feet, I went to lift her off the Bed; when she felt to my Touch in the oddest Manner imaginable: for while in one respect it was as though she had been cased in 
[Page 146]
Whalebone, it was at the same Time as soft and warm, as if she had been naked. 
I then took her in my Arms and carried her into my Anti-chamber again; where I would fain have entered into Conversation, but found she and I could make nothing of it together, unless we could understand one another's Speech. It is very strange, my Dream should have prepossessed me so of Patty, and of the Alteration of her Countenance, that I could by no Means persuade myself, the Person I had with me was not she; though, upon a deliberate Comparison, Patty, as pleasing as she always was to my Taste, would no more come up to this fair Creature, than a course Alewise would to Venus herself. 
You may imagine, we stared heartily at each other, and I doubted not but she wondred as much as I, by what Means we came so near each other. I offered her every thing in my Grotto, which I thought might please her; some of which she gratefully received, as appeared by her Looks and Behaviour. But she avoided my Lamp, and always placed her Back toward it. I observing that, and ascribing it to her Modesty, in my Company, let her have her, Will, and took care to set it in such a Position myself, as seem'd agreeable to her, tho' it deprived me of a Prospect I very much admired. 
After we had sat a good while, now and then, 
[Page 147]
I may say, chattering to one another, she got up, and took a turn or two about the Room. When I saw her in that Attitude, her Grace and Motion perfectly charmed me, and her Shape was incomparable; but the Strangeness of her Dress put me to my Trumps, to conceive either what it was, or how it was put on. 
Well, we supped together, and I set the best of every thing I had before her, nor could either of us forbear speaking in our own Tongue, tho' we were sensible neither of us understood the other. After Supper I gave her some of my Cordials, for which she shewed great Tokens of Thankfulness, and often, in her way, by Signs and Gestures, which were very far from being insignificant, expressed her Gratitude for my Kindness. When Supper had been some time over, I shewed her my Bed, and made Signs for her to go to it; but she seemed very shy of that, 'till I shewed her where I meant to lie myself, by pointing to myself, then to that, and again pointing to her and to my Bed. When at length I had made this matter intelligible to her, she lay down very composedly; and after I had taken Care of my Fire, and set the Things I had been using for Supper in their Places, I laid myself down too: For I could have no suspicious Thoughts, or fear of Danger, from a Form so excellent. 
I treated her for some Time with all the Respect 
[Page 148]
imaginable, and never suffered her to do the least part of my Work. It was very inconvenient to both of us, only to know each others Meaning by Signs; but I could not be otherwise than pleas'd to see, that she endeavoured all in her Power to learn to talk like me. Indeed I was not behind Hand with her in that Respect, striving all I could to imitate her. What I all the while wondered at was, she never shewed the least disquiet at her Confinement: For I kept my Door shut at first, thro' fear of loosing her, thinking she would have taken an Opportunity to run away from me; for little did I then think she could fly, 
CHAP. XV. 

Wilkin's afraid of loosing his new Mistress; they live together all Winter; a Remark on that; they begin to know each others Language; a long Discourse between them at cross purposes; she flies; they engage to be Man and Wife. 
After my new Love had been with me a Fortnight, finding my Water run low, I was greatly troubled at the thought of quitting her any time, to go for more; and having hinted it to her, with seeming Uneasiness, she could not for a while fathom my Meaning; but when she saw me much confused, she came at length, by the many Signs I made, to imagine it was my Concern for her which made me so; whereupon 
[Page 149]
she expressively enough signified I might be easy, for she did not fear any thing happening to her, in my Absence. On this, as well as I could declare my meaning, I intreated her not to go away before my Return. As soon as she understood what I signified to her, by Actions, she sat down, with her Arms across, leaning her Head against the Wall, to assure me she would not stir. However, as I had before nailed a Cord to the outside of the Door, I tyed that for Caution's sake, to the Tree, for fear of the worst: but I believe she had not the least Design of removing. 
I took my Boat, Net, and Water-Cask, as usual; desirous of bringing her home a fresh Fish Dinner; and succeeded so well as to catch enough for several good Meals, and to spare. What remain'd I salted, and found she liked that better than the fresh, after a few Days salting; tho' she did not so well approve of that I had formerly pickled and dryed. As my Salt grew very low, tho' I had been as sparing of it as possible, I now resolved to try making some; and the next Summer I effected it. 
Thus we spent the Remainder of the Winter together, 'till the Days began to be light enough for me to walk abroad a little in the middle of them: for I was now under no Apprehensions of her leaving me; as she had before this time had so 
[Page 150]
many Opportunities of doing so, but never once attempted it. 
I must here make one Reflection upon our Conduct, which you will almost think incredible, viz. That we two, of different Sexes, not wanting our peculiar Desires, fully inflamed with Love to each other, and no outward Obstacle to prevent our Wishes, should have been together, under the same Roof, alone, for five Months, conversing together from Morning to Night, (for by this time she pretty well understood English, and I her Language) and yet, I should never have clasped her in my Arms, or have shewn any further amorous Desires to her, than what the Deference I all along paid her could give her room to surmise. Nay, I can affirm, that I did not even then know, that the Covering she wore, was not the work of Art, but the work of Nature; for I really took it for Silk: tho' it must be premised, that I had never seen it by any other Light, than of my Lamp. Indeed the Modesty of her Carriage, and Sweetness of her Behaviour to me, had struck into me such a Dread of offending her, that, tho' nothing upon Earth could be more capable of exciting Passion than her Charms, I could have died, rather than have attempted to salute her only, without actual Invitation. 
When the Weather cleared up a little, by the lengthening of Day light, I took Courage one 
[Page 151]
Afternoon to invite her to walk with me to the Lake; but she sweetly excused herself from it, whilst there was such a frightful Glare of Light, as she said; but, looking out at the Door, told me, if I would not go out of the Wood, she would accompany me: so we agreed to take a Turn only there. I first went myself over the Style of the Door, and thinking it rather too high for her, I took her in my Arms and lifted her over. But even when I had her in this manner, I knew not what to make of her Cloathing, it sat so true and close; but seeing her by a steadier and truer Light in the Grove, tho' a heavy gloomy one, than my Lamp had afforded, I begged she would let me know of what Silk or other Composition her Garment was made. She smil'd, and ask'd me, if mine was not the same under my Jacket. No lady, says I, I have nothing but my Skin under my Cloaths. Why what do you mean? replies she somewhat tartly; but indeed I was afraid something was the Matter, by that nasty Covering you wear, that you might not be seen. Are not you a * 1 Glumm? Yes, says I, fair Creature. (Here, tho' you may conceive she spoke part English, part her own Tongue, and I the same, as we best understood each other, yet I shall give you our Discourse, Word for Word, in plain English) Then, says she, I am afraid you must have been a very bad Man, and have been 
[Page 152]
Crashee * 2 , which I should be very sorry to hear. I told her I believed we were none of us so good as we might be, but I hoped my Faults had not at most exceeded other Mens; but I had suffered Abundance of Hardships in my time; and that at last Providence having settled me in this Spot, from whence I had no Prospect of ever departing, it was none of the least of it's Mercies, to bring to my Knowledge and Company, the most exquisite Piece of all his Works, in her; which I should acknowledge as long as I lived. She was surpriz'd at this Discourse, and asked me, (if I did not mean to impose upon her, and was indeed an Ingcrashee ‡ 3 Glumm) why I should tell her I had no Prospect of departing from hence? Have not you, says she, the same Prospect, that I or any other Person has of departing? Sir, added she, you don't do well, and really I fear you are slit, or you would not wear this nasty cumbersome Coat, (taking hold of my Jacket Sleeve) if you were not afraid of shewing the Signs of a bad Life upon your natural Cloathing. 
I could not for my Heart imagine what Way there was to get out of my Dominions; but certainly, thought I, there must be some or other, or she would not be so peremptory. And as to my Jacket, and shewing myself in my natural Cloathing, I profesi she made me blush; and, but for shame, I would have stripped to my Skin, to haue satisfied her. But, Madam, 
[Page 153]
says I, pray Pardon me, for you are really mistaken; I have examined every Nook and Corner of this new World, in which we now are, and can find no possible Outlet; nay, even by the same way I came in, I am sure it is impossible to get out again. Why, says she, what Outlets have you searched for, or what way can you expect out, but the way you came in? And why is that impossible to return by again? If you are not slit, is not the Air open to you? Will not the Sky admit You to patrole in it, as well as other People? I tell you, Sir, I fear you have been slit for your Crimes; and tho' you have been so good to me, that I can't help loving of you heartily for it; yet, if I thought you had been slit, I would not, nay could not, stay a Moment longer with you; no, tho' it should break my Heart to leave you. 
I found myself now in a strange Quandary, longing to know what she meant by being slit; and had a hundred strange Notions in my Head whether I was slit or not; for tho' I knew what the Word naturally signified well enough, yet in what manner, or by what Figure of Speech, she applied it to me, I had no Idea of. But seeing her look a little angrily upon me, pray Madam, says I, don't be offended, if I take the Liberty to ask you what you mean by the word Crashee* 4 , so often repeated by you; for I am an utter Stranger to what you mean by it. Sir, says she, pray answer me first, how you came here. Madam, replied I, will you please: 
[Page 154]
to take a Walk to the Verge of the Wood, and I will shew you the very Passage. Sir, says she, I perfectly know the Range of the Rocks all round; and by the least Description, without going to see them, can tell from which you descended. In truth, said I, most charming Lady, I descended from no Rock at all; nor would I for a thousand Worlds attempt what could not be accomplished but by my Destruction. Sir, says she, in some Anger, it is false, and you impose upon me. I declare to you, says I, Madam, what I tell you is strictly true, I never was near the Summit of any of the surrounding Rocks, or any thing like it; but as you are not far from the Verge of the Wood, be so good as to step a little further, and I will shew you my Entrance in hither. Well, says she, now this odious dazzle of Light is lessened, I don't care if I do go with you. 
When we came far enough to see the Bridge; there, Madam, says I, there is my Entrance, where the Sea pours into this Lake from yonder Cavern. It is not possible, says she; this is another Untruth; and as I see you would deceive me, and are not to be believed, farewel; I must be gone. But hold, says she, let me ask you one thing more; that is, by what means did you come through that Cavern? you could not have used to have come over the Rock. Bless me, Madam, says I, do you think I and my Boat could fly? Come over the Rock did 
[Page 155]
you say? No Madam, I sailed from the great Sea, the main Ocean, in my Boat, thro' that Cavern, into this very Lake here. What do you mean by your Boat, says she? You seem to make two Things of your Boat, you say you failed with, and yourself. I do so, replied I, for, Madam, I take myself to be good Flesh and Blood, but my Boat is made of Wood and other Materials. Is it so, says she, and pray where is this Boat that is made of Wood and other Materials, under your Jacket? Lord! Madam, says I, you put me in fear, that you was angry; but now I hope you only Joke with me; what, put a Boat under my Jacket! No, Madam, my Boat is in the Lake. What! more Untruths, says she. No, Madam, I replied, if you would be satisfied of what I say, every Word of which is as true as that my Boat now is in the Lake, pray walk with me thither, and make your own Eyes judges, what Sincerity I speak with. To this she agreed, it growing Dusky; but assured me, if I did not give her good Satisfaction, I should see her no more. 
We arrived at the Lake; and going to my wet Dock, now, Madam, says I, pray satisfy yourself, whether I spake true or no. She looked at my Boat, but could not yet frame a proper Notion of it. Says I, Madam, in this very Boat, I sailed from the main Ocean, thro' that Cavern, into this Lake; and shall at last think myself the happiest of all Men, if you 
[Page 156]
continue with me, love me and credit me; and I promise you I'll never deceive you, but think my Life happily spent in your Service. I found she was hardly content yet to believe what I told her of my Boat to be true; 'till I stepped into it, and pushing from the Shore, took my Oars in my Hand, and sailed along the Lake by her, as she walked on the Shore. At last, she seemed so well reconciled to me and my Boat, that she desired I would take her in. I immediately did so, and we sailed a good way; and as we return'd to my Dock, I described to her how I procured the Water we drank, and brought it to Shore in that Vessel. 
Well, says she, I have sailed, as you call it, many a Mile in my Life time, but never in such a thing as this. I own it will serve very well, where one has a great many Things to carry from Place to Place; but, to be labouring thus at an Oar, when one intends Pleasure in sailing, is in my Mind a most ridiculous Piece of Slavery. Why, pray Madam, how would you have me sail? for, getting into the Boat only, will not carry us this way or that, without using some force. But, says she, pray where did you get this Boat, as you call it? O! Madam, says I, that is too long and fatal a Story to begin upon now; this Boat was made many thousand Miles from hence, among a People coal black, a quite different sort from us; and, 
[Page 157]
when I first had it, I little thought of seeing this Country; but I will make a faithful Relation of all to you, when we come home. Indeed I began to wish heartily we were there, for it grew into the Night; and having strolled so far without my Gun, I was afraid of what I had before seen and heard, and hinted our Return; but I found my Motion was disagreeable to her, and so I dropped it. 
I now perceiv'd, and wondered at it, that the later it grew, the more agreeable it seemed to her; and as I had now brought her into a good Humour again, by seeing and sailing in my Boat, I was not willing to prevent it's Increase: I told her if she pleas'd we would land, and when I had docked my Boat I would accompany her where and as long as she liked. As we talked, and walked by the Lake, she made a little run before me, and sprung into it. Perceiving this, I cryed out; whereupon she merrily called on me to follow her. The Light was then so dim, as prevented my having more than a confused Sight of her, when she jumped in; and looking earnestly after her, I could discern nothing more than a small Boat, on the Water, which skimm'd along at so great a Rate that I almost lost sight of it presently; but running along the Shore, for fear of losing her, I met her gravely walking to meet me; and then had entirely lost sight of the Boat upon the Lake. 
[Page 158]
This, says she, accosting me with a Smile, is my way of Sailing, which, I perceive by the Fright you were in, you are altogether unacquainted with; and as you tell me you came from so many thousand Miles off, it is possible you may be made differently from me; but surely we are the part of the Creation which has had most Care bestow'd upon it: And I suspect from all your Discourse, to which I have been very attentive, it is possible you may no more be able to fly, than to sail, as I do. No, charming Creature, says I, that I can't, I'll assure you. She then stepping to the Edge of the Lake, for the Advantage of a Descent before her, sprung up into the Air, and away she went, further than my Eyes could follow her. 
I was quite astonished. So, says I, then all is over, all a Delusion which I have so long been in, a meer Phantom! better had it been for me never to have seen her, than thus to lose her again! But what could I expect, had she stay'd? for it is plain she is no human Composition. But, says I, she felt like Flesh too, when I lifted her out at the Door. -I had but very little time for Reflection; for in about ten Minutes after she had left me in this Mixture of Grief and Amazement, she alighted just by me, on her Feet. 
Her Return, as she plainly saw, filled me with a Transport not to be concealed; and which, as she afterwards told me, was very agreeable to 
[Page 159]
her. Indeed I was some Moments in such an Agitation of Mind, from these unparallelled Incidents, that I was like one Thunder struck; but coming presently to myself, and clasping her in my Arms, with as much Love and Passion as I was capable of expressing, and for the first Time with any Desire, are you returned again, kind Angel, said I, to bless a Wretch who can only be happy in adoring you? Can it be, that you who have so many Advantages over me, should quit all the Pleasures that Nature has formed you for, and all your Friends and Relations, to take an Asylum in my Arms? But I here make you a tender of all I am able to bestow, my Love and Constancy. ---Come, come, says she, no more Raptures, I find you are a worthier Man than I thought I had Reason to take you for; and I beg your Pardon for my Distrust, whilst I was ignorant of your Imperfections; but now, I verily believe all you have said is true; and I promise you, as you have seemed so much to delight in me, I will never quit you 'till Death, or other as fatal Accident shall part us. But we will now, if you chuse, go home, for I know you have been some time uneasy in this Gloom, tho' agreeable to me: For, giving my Eyes the Pleasure of looking eagerly on you, it conceals my Blushes from your Sight. 
In this Manner, exchanging mutual Endearments, and soft Speeches, Hand in Hand, we 
[Page 160]
arrived at the Grotto; where we that Night consummated our Nuptials, without further Ceremony than mutual solemn Engagements to each other: which are, in truth, the Essence of Marriage, and all that was there and then in our Power. 
CHAP. XVI. 

The Author's Disappointment at first going to bed with his new Wife; some strange Circumstances relating thereto; she resolves several Questions he asks her, and clears up his Fears as to the Voices; A Description of Swangeans. 
Every Calm is succeeded by a Storm, as is every Storm by it's Calm; for, after Supper, in order to give my Bride the Opportunity of undressing alone, which I thought might be most agreeable the first Night, I withdrew into the Antichamber, 'till I thought she was laid; and then, having first disposed of my Lamp, I moved softly towards her, and stepped into Bed too; when, on my nearer approach to her, I imagined she had her Cloaths on. This struck a thorough Damp over me; and asking her the Reason of it, not being able to touch the least bit of her Flesh, but her Face and Hands, she burst out a laughing; and running her Hand along my naked Side, soon perceived the Difference, she before had made such doubt of, between 
[Page 161]
herself and me. Upon which she fairly told me, that neither she, or any Person she had ever seen before, had any other Covering than what they were born with, and which they would not willingly part with but with their Lives. This shocked me terribly; not from the Horror of the thing itself, or any distaste I had to this Covering, for it was quite smooth, warm, and softer than Velvet, or the finest Skin imaginable; but from an Apprehension of her being so wholly incased in it, that tho' I had so fine a Companion, and now a Wife, yet, I should have no conjugal Benefit from her, either to my own Gratification, or the Increase of our Species. 
In the Height of my Impatience, I made divers Essays for unfolding this Covering, but unsuccessfully. Surely, says I, there must be some Way of coming at my Wishes; or why should she seem so shy of me at first, and now we are under Engagements to each other, meet me half Way with such a yielding Compliance. I could, if I had had Time to spare, have gone on, starting Objections and answering them, in my own Breast, a great while longer, (for I now knew not what to make of it;) but being prompted to act as well as think, and feeling, as tenderly as possible, upon her Bosom, for the Folds or Plaits of her Garment, she lying perfectly still, and perceiving divers flat broad ledges, 
[Page 162]
like Whalebone, seemingly under her Covering, which closely infolded her Body, I thought, it might be all laced on together, somewhat like Stays, and felt behind for the Lacing. At length, perceiving me so puzzled, and beyond Conception vexed at my Disappointment; of a sudden, lest I should grow outragious, which I was almost come to, she threw down all those seeming Ribbs, flat to her Side, so imperceptably to me, that I knew nothing of the Matter, though I lay close to her; 'till putting forth my Hand again to her Bosom, the softest Skin and most delightful Body, free from all Impediment, presented itself to my Wishes, and gave up itself to my Embraces. 
I slept very soundly 'till Morning, and so did she; but at waking I was very solicitous to find out what Sort of Being I had had in my Arms, and with what Qualities her Garment was endued, or how contrived, that notwithstanding all my fruitless Attempts to uncover her, she herself could so instantaneously dispose of it, undiscerned by me: Well, thought I, she is my Wife, I will be satisfied in every Thing, for surely she will not now refuse to gratify my Curiosity. 
We rose with the Light; but surely no two were ever more amorous, or more delighted with each other. I being up first, lighted the Fire, and prepared Breakfast of some Fish Soup, thickened 
[Page 163]
with my Cream-Cheese; and then calling her, I kept my Eye towards the Bed to see how she dress'd herself; but throwing aside the Cloaths, she stepped out ready dressed, and came to me. When I had kissed her, and wished her a good Day, we sat down to Breakfast; which being soon over, I told her, I hoped every Minute of our Lives would prove as happy as those we so lately passed together; which she seemed to wish with equal Ardour. I then told her, now she was my Wife, I thought proper to know her Name, which I had never before asked, for fear of giving Uneasiness; for, as I added, I did not doubt, she had observed in my Behaviour, ever since I first saw her, a peculiar Tenderness for her, and a sedulous Concern not to offend; which had obliged me, hitherto, to stifle several Questions I had to ask her, whenever they wou'd be agreeable to her. She then bid me begin, for as she was now my Wife, whilst I was speaking it became her to be all Attention, and to give me the utmost Satisfaction she could in all I should require, as she herself should have so great an Interest in every thing for the Future which would oblige me. 
Compliments (if in compliance with old Custom I may call 'em so, for they were by us delivered from the Heart) being a little over on both sides, I first desired to know what Name she went by, before I found her: For, says I, 
[Page 164]
having only hitherto called you Madam, and my Lady; besides the future Expression of my Love to you in the Word Dear, I would know your original Name, that so I might join it with that tender Epithet. That you shall, says she, and also my Family at another Opportunity; but as my Name will not take up long Time to repeat at present, it is Youwarkee. And pray, says she, now gratify me with the Knowledge of yours. My dear Youwarkee, says I, my Name was Peter Wilkins when I heard it last; but that is so long ago, I had almost forgot it. And now, says I, there is another Thing you can give me a Pleasure in. You need then only mention it, my dear Peter, says she. That is, says I, only to tell me, if you did not, by some Accident, fall from the Top of the Rock over my Habitation, upon the Roof of it, when I first took you in here; and whether you are of the Country upon the Rocks? She, softly smiling, answered, my dear Peter you run your Questions too thick; as to my Country, which is not on the Rocks, as you suppose, but at a vast Distance from hence, I shall leave that, 'till I may hereafter, at more Leisure, speak of my Family, as I promised you before; but as to how I came into this Grotto, I knew not at first, but soon perceived your Humanity had brought me in, to take Care of me, after a terrible Fall I had: not from the Rock, as you suppose; for 
[Page 165]
then I must not now have been Living to enjoy you; but from a far less considerable Height in the Air. I'll tell you how it happened. A Parcel of us young People were upon a merry Swangean, * 5 round this Arkoe, † 6 which we usually divert our selves with at set Times of the Year, chasing and pursuing one another, sometimes times soaring to an extravagant Height, and then shooting down again with surprizing Precipitancy, 'till we even touch the Trees; when, of a sudden, we mount again and away. I say, being of this Party, and pursued by one of my Comrades, I descended down to the very Trees, and she after me; but, as I mounted, she over-shooting me, brushed so stiffly against the upper part of my Graundee, ‡ 7 that I lost my bearing; and being so near the Branches, before I could recover it again, I sunk into the Tree, and rendered my Graundee useless to me, so that down I came, and that with so much Force, that I but just felt my Fall, and lost my Senses. Whether I cryed out or no upon my coming to the Ground I cannot say; but if I did, my Companion was too far gone by that time to hear or take Notice of me; as she probably, in so swift a Flight, saw not my Fall. As to the Condition 
[Page 166]
I was in, or what happened immediately afterwards, I must be obliged to you for a Relation of that: But one thing I was quickly sensible of, and never can forget, viz. that I owe my Life to your Care, and Kindness to me. 
I told her she should have that part of her Story from me another time; but, says I, there is something so amazing in these Flights, or Swangeans, as you call them, that I must, as the Questions for this Day, beg you would let me know, what is the Method of 'em? what's the Nature of your Covering? (which was at first such an Obstacle to my Wishes) how you put it on? and how you Use it in your Swangean? 
Surely, my dearest Peter, says she, but that I can deny you nothing, since you are my Barkatt, * 8 which you seem so passionately to desire, the latter of your Questions would not be answered, for it must put me to the Blush. As to our Method of Flight, you saw somewhat of that, last Night; tho' in a Light hardly sufficient for you; and, for the Nature of my Covering, you perceive that now: but to shew you how it is put on, as you call it, I am afraid it will be necessary, as far as I can, to put it off, before I can make you comprehend that; which having done, the whole will be no further a Mystery. But, not to be tedious, is it your Command that I uncover? Lay that upon me, it shall be 
[Page 167]
done. Here I was at a Plunge, whether to proceed, or drop the Question. Thinks I, if my Curiosity should be fatal to me, as I may see something I can never bear hereafter, I am undone. She waits the Command! why so? I know not the Consequence. What shall I do? At last, somewhat resolutely, I asked her, Whether her Answer, either way, to my Command, would cause her to leave me, or me to love her less. She seeing my Hesitation, and perceiving the Cause, was so pleased, that she cryed out, No, my dear Peter, nor that, nor all the force on Earth, shall ever part me from you. But I conceive you are afraid, you shall discover something in me, you may not like; I fear not that; but an immodest Appearance before you, I can't suffer myself to be guilty of, but under your own Command. 
My lovely Youwarkee, says I, delay then my Desires no longer; and since you require a Warrant from me. I do command you to do it. Immediately her Graundes flew open, (discovering her naked Body, just to the Hip, and round the Rim of her Belly,) and expanding itself, was near six Feet wide. Here my Love and Curiosity had a hard Conflict; the one to gain my Attention to the Graundee, and the other to retain my Eyes and Thoughts on her lovely Body, which I had never beheld so much of before. Tho' I was very unwilling to keep her uncovered too 
[Page 168]
long, I could not easily dismiss so charming a Sight. I attentively view'd her lovely Flesh, and examined the Case that enshrined it: but as I shall give you a full Description of this Graundee hereafter, in a more proper Place, I will mention it no further here, than to tell you, that when I had narrowly surveyed the upper part of it, she in a Moment contracted it round her so close, that the nicest Eye could not perceive the joining of the Parts. 
Indeed my dear Youwarkee, says I, you had the best of Reasons for saying you was not fearful I should discover any thing in you displeasing; for, if my Bosom glow'd with Love before, you have now therein raised an ardent Flame, which neither Time or ought else will ever be able to extinguish. I now almost conceive how you fly: Tho' yet I am at a Loss to know, how you extend and make Use of the lower part of your Graundee, which rises up and meets the upper; but I will rather guess at that, by what I have seen, than raise the Colour higher in those fair Cheeks, which are however adorn'd with Blushes. Then running to her, and taking her in my Arms, I called her the Gift of Heaven; and lest off further Interrogatories 'till another Opportunity. 

[Page 169]

CHAP. XVII. 

Youwarkee cannot bear a strong Light; Wilkins makes her Spectacles which help her; a Description of them. 
Youwarkee and I having no other Company than one another's, we talked together almost from Morning to Night, in order to learn each others Dialect. But how compliable soever she was in all other Respects, I could not perswade her to go out with me to fetch Water, or to the Lake, in the Day time. It being now the light Season, I wanted her to be more abroad; but she excused herself, telling me her People never came into those luminous Parts of the Country, during the false Glare, as they called it, but kept altogether at Home, where their Light was more moderate and steddier; and that the Place where I resided, was not frequented by them for half the Year; and at other Times only upon Parties of Pleasure; it not being worth while to settle Habitations, where they could not abide always. She said Normbdsgrsutt, was the finest Region in the World, where her King's Court was, and a vast Kingdom. I asked her twice or thrice more to name the Country to me; but not all the Art we could use, her's in dictating, and mine in endeavouring to pronounce it, would render 
[Page 170]
me Conqueror of that poor Monosyllable, (for as such it sounded form her sweet Lips:) So I relinquished the Name to her; telling her, whenever she had any more Occasion to mention the Place, I desired it might be under the Stile of Doorpt Swangeanti; * 9 which she promised; but wondered, as she could speak the other so glibly, as she called it, I could not do so too. 
I told her, that the Light of my Native Country was far stronger than any I had seen since my Arrival at Graundevolet, (for that, I found by her, was the Name my Dominions went by;) and that we had a Sun, or Ball of Fire, which roll'd over our Heads every Day, with such a Light and such a Heat, that it would sometimes almost scorch one, it was so hot; and was of such Brightness, that the Eye could not look at it without Danger of Blindness. She was heartily glad, she said, she was not born in so wretched a Land; and she did not believe there was any other so good as her own. I thought no Benefit could arise from my Combating these innocent Prejudices, so I let 'em alone. 
She had often lamented to me, the Difference of our Eye-Sight, and the Trouble it was to her, that she could not at all Times go about with me; 'till it gave me a good deal of Uneasiness to see her Concern. At last I told her, 
[Page 171]
that tho' I believ'd it would be impossible to reduce my Sight to the Standard of her's, yet I was perswaded, I could bring her's to bear the strongest Light I had ever seen in this Country. She was mightily pleased with the Thought of that, and said she wished I might; for she was sensible of no Grief, like being obliged to stay at Home, when I went abroad on my Business; and was resolved to try my Experiment, if I pleased; and in the mean Time should heartily pray for the Success. -I light on the following Invention. 
I rumaged over all my old Things, and by good Luck found an old crape Hatband. This I tried myself, single, before my own Eyes, in the strongest Light we had; but, believing I had not yet obscured it enough, I doubled it, and then thought it might do; but for fear it should not, I trebled it; and then it seemed too dark for Eyes like mine to discover Objects thro' it, and so I judged it would suit her's: For I was determined to produce something, if possible, that would do, at first, without Repetition of Tryal; which I thought would only deject her more, by making her look on the Matter as impracticable. I now only wanted a proper Method for fixing it on her; and this I thought would be easily effected; but had much more Difficulty in it than I imagined. At first I purposed to tye the Crape over her Eyes; but trying it myself, I found it very rough and fretting. 
[Page 172]
I then designed fixing it to an old Crown of a Hat, that held my Fish Hooks and Lines, and so let it hang down before her Face: but that also had its Inconveniences, as it would flap her Eyes in windy Weather, and would be not only useless but very troublesome in Flight: so that I was scarce ever more puzzled before. At last I thought of a Method that answered exceedingly well; the Hint of which I took from somewhat I had seen with my Master, when I was at School, which he called Goggles, and which he used to tie round his Head, to skreen his Eyes in riding. The thing I made upon that Plan was compos'd of old Hat, pieces of Ram's-horn, and the above mentioned Crape. 
When I had finished the whole Apparatus, I tried it first upon myself, and finding great Reason to believe it would perfectly answer the Intention. I ran directly to Youwarkee. Come, says I, my Dear, will you go with me to the Water Rill? for I must fetch some this Morning. She shook her Head, and with Tears in her Eyes wished she could; but, says she, let me see how light it is abroad? No, says I, my Love, you must not look out till you go. Indeed, says she, if it did not affect my Eyes and Head, you should not ask me twice. Well, says I, my Youwarkee, I am now come to take you with me; and that you may not suffer by it, turn about, and let 
[Page 173]
me apply the Remedy I told you of for your Sight. She wanted much to see first what it was; but I begged her to forbear, till she tried whether it would be useful or not. She told me, she would absolutely submit to my Direction; so I adjusted the thing to her Head. Now, says I, you have it on, let us go out and try it; and let me know the Moment you find the Light offensive, and take particular Notice how you are affected. Hereupon away we marched, and I heard no Complaint in all our Walk to the Lake. 
Now my dear Youwarkee, says I, when we got there, what do you think of my Contrivance, can you see at all? Yes, very well, says she. But, my dear Peter, you have taken the Advantage of the twilight, I know, to deceive me; and I had rather have stay'd at Home, than have subjected you to return in the Night, for the Sake of my Company. I then assured her it was Mid-Day, and no later, which pleased her mightily; and to satisfy her, I untied the String behind, and just let her be convinced it was so. When I had fixed the Shade on her Head again, she put up her Hands, and felt the several Materials of which it consisted; and after expressing her Admiration of it, so my dear Peter, says she, you have now encumbered yourself with a Wife indeed, for since I can come abroad in a glaring Light, with so 
[Page 174]
much Ease, you will never henceforward be without my Company. 
Youwarkee being thus in Spirits, we launched the Boat, watered, took a Draft of Fish, and return'd; passing the Night at home, in talking of the Spectacles, (for that was the Name I told her they must go by) and of the Fishing: for that Exercise delighted her to a great Degree. But, above all, the Spectacles were her chief Theme; she handled 'em and look'd at 'em again and again, and ask'd several rational. Questions about them; as how they could have that Effect on her Eyes, enabling her to see, and the like. She ventured out, with them on, next Day by herself; and as she threatned, she was as good as her Word, for she scarcely afterwards let me go abroad by myself, but accompanied me every where freely, and with Delight. 
CHAP. XVIII. 

Youwarkee with Child; Wilkins's Stock of Provisions; no Beast or Fish in Youwarkee's Country; the Voices again; her Reason for not seeing those who uttered 'em; she bears a Son; a hard Speech in her lying in; divers Birds appear; their Eggs gathered; how Wilkins kept Account of Time. 
About three Months after we were married, as we called it, Youwarkee told me she believed 
[Page 175]
she was Breeding; and I was mightily pleased with it: for tho' I had had two Children before, by Patty, yet I had never seen either of them; so that I longed to be a Father. I sometimes amused myself with whimsical Conjectures, as whether the Child would have a Graundee, or not; which of us it would be most like; how we should do without a Midwife; and what must become of the Infant, as we had no Milk, in Case Youwarkee could not suckle it. Indeed I had leisure enough for indulging such Reveries; for having laid in our Winter Stores, my Wife and I had nothing to do but enjoy our selves over a good Fire, pratling and toying together, making as good Chear as we could: and truly that was none of the worst; for we had as fine Bread as need to be eaten; we had Pears preserved; all Sorts of dry'd Fish; and once a Fortnight, for two or three Days together, had fresh Fish; we had Vinegar; and a biting Herb, I had found, for Pepper; and several Sorts of Nuts; so there was no want. 
It was at this Time, after my Return from watering one Day, where Youwarkee had been with me; that, having taken several Fish, and amongst them some I had not before seen, I asked her, as we were preparing and salting some of them, how they managed Fish in her Country, and what Variety they had of them there? She told me, she neither ever saw, or heard of 
[Page 176]
a Fish in her Life, 'till she came to me. How! says I, no Fish amongst you? why you want one of the greatest Dainties that can be set upon a Table. Do you wholly eat Flesh, says I, at Doorpt Swangeanti? Flesh, says she, laughingly, of what? Nay, says I, you know best what the Beasts of your own Country are; we have in England, where I was born and bred, Oxen, very large Hogs, Sheep, Lambs, and Calves; these make our ordinary Dishes; then, we have Deer, Hares, Rabbits, and these are reckoned Dainties; besides numberless kinds of Poultry, and Fish without stint. I never heard of any of these things in my Life, says Youwarkee; nor did I ever eat any thing but Fruits, and Herbs, and what is made from them at Normbdsgrsutt. You will speak that crabbed Word, says I, again. I beg your Pardon, my Dear, says she: at Doorpt Swangeanti, I say, nor I, or any one else, to my Knowledge, ever eat any such thing. But seeing you eat Fish, as you call them, I made no Scruple of doing so too; and like them very well, especially the salted ones: for I never tasted what you call Salt, neither, 'till I came here. I can't think, says I, what sort of a Country yours is, or how you all live there. O says she, there's no want; I wish you and I were there. -I was afraid I had talked too much of her Country already, so we called a new Cause. 
Soon after Winter had set in, as we were in 
[Page 177]
Bed one Night, I heard the Voices again. And tho' my Wife had told me of her Country Folks, Swangeans, in that Place, I being frighted a little, waked her; and she hearing them too, cry'd out, there they are, it is ten to one but my Sister or some of our family are there; hark! I believe I hear her Voice. I myself hearkened very attentively; and by this time understanding a great deal of their Language, I not only could distinguish different Speakers, but knew the Meaning of several of the Words they pronounced. 
I would have had Youwarkee have gotten up, and called to them. Not for the World, says she, have you a Mind to part with me? Tho' I have no Intent to leave you, as I am with Child, if they should try to force me away, without my Consent, I may receive some Injury, to the Danger of my own Life, or at least of the Child's. This Reason perfectly satisfying me, endeared the loving Creature to me ten times more, if possible, than ever. 
The next Summer brought me a Yawm, * 10 as fair as Alabaster. My Wife was delivered without the usual Assistance, and had as favourable a Labour as could be. The first thing I did, after giving her some Fish Soup, made as skilfully as I was able, and a little Cordial, was, to see if my Yawm had the Graundee, or not. 
[Page 178]
Finding it had, so, says I, to Youwarkee, you have brought me a legitimate Heir to my Dominions, whose Title sure can't he disputed, being one of you. Tho' I spoke this, with as much Pleasure, and in as endearing a way, as ever I spoke in my Life, and quite innocently; the poor Youwarkee burst into Tears, to such Excess, there was no pacifying her. I asked her the Reason of her Grief, begged and intreated her to let me know what disturbed her; but all in Vain; 'till seeing me in a violent Passion, such as I had never before appeared to be in, she told me, she was very sorry I should Question her Fidelity to me. She surprized me in saying this, as I never had any such Apprehension. No, my dearest Wife, says I, I never had any such Suspicion as you Charge me with, I can safely affirm; nor can I comprehend your Meaning by imputing such a thing to me. Oh! says she, I am sure you have no Cause for it, but, you said the poor Child was one of us, as much as to intimate, that had it been your own, it would have been born as you were, without the Graundee: Which Thought I can't bear; and if you continue to think so, it must end me; therefore take away my Life now, rather than let me live to see my further Misery. 
I was heartily sorry for what I had said, when I saw the Effects of it, tho' I did not imagine it could have been perverted to such a contrary 
[Page 179]
Meaning. But considering her to be the faithfullest and most loving Creature upon Earth, and that true Love can't bear any thing that touches upon, or can be applied (though with ever so forced a Construction) to an opprobrious or contemptuous Meaning, I attributed her groundless Resentment, to her Excess of Fondness only for me; and falling upon the Bed by her, and bathing her Face in my Tears, I assured her, the Interpretation she had put on my Words, was altogether foreign from the view they were spoken with; professing to her, that I never had, nor ever could have, the least Cause of Jealousy. On my confirming this absolute Confidence in her Virtue, by the strongest Asseverations, she grew fully convinced of her Error, and acknowledged she had been too rash in censuring me: and growing pleased at my fresh Professions of Love to her, we presently were reconciled, and became again very good Friends. 
When Youwarkee had gathered Strength again, she prov'd an excellent Nurse to my Pedro, for that was the Name I gave him, so that he soon grew a charming Child, able to go in his twelfth Month, and spoke in his twentieth. This and two other lovely Boys I had by her within three Years; every one of which she brought up with the Breast, and they thriv'd delicately. 
I don't mention the little intervening Occurrences 
[Page 180]
which happened during this Period; they consisting chiefly of the old Rota, of fishing, watering, providing in the Summer for the Winter, and in managing my Saltwork: which, altogether, kept me at full Imployment, comfortably to maintain an encreasing Family. 
In this time, I had found out several new Sorts of Eatables. I had observed, as I said before, abundance of Birds about the Wood and Lake, in the Summer Months. These, by firing at 'em two or three times, on my first coming, I had almost caused to desert my Dominions. But as I had, for the last two or three Years, given no Disturbance at all to them, they were now in as great Plenty as ever: And I made great Profit of them, by the Peace they enjoy'd; and yet my Table nevet wanted a Supply, fresh in the Summer, or salted and pickled in Winter. 
I took Notice, it was about October these Birds used to come; and most of the Month of November they were busy in laying their Eggs, which I used at that time to find in great Plenty, along the Banks of the Lake, in the Reeds, and made great Collections of them; I used also to find a great many in the Woods, amongst the Shrubs and Underwood. These furnished our Table various Ways; for, with my Cream Cheese Flower, and a little Mixture of Ramshorn Juice, I had taught my Wife to make excellent Puddings of 'em; abundance of them also we eat 
[Page 181]
boiled or fryed, alone, and often as Sauce to our Fish. As for the Birds themselves, having long omitted to Fire at them, I had an effectual Means of taking them otherwise, by Nets, which I set between the Trees, and also very large pitfal Nets, with which I used to catch all Sorts, even from the size of a Thrush to that of a Turkey. But as I shall say more of these when I come to speak of my Ward, by and by, and of my Poultry, I shall omit any further mention of 'em here. 
You may perhaps wonder how I could keep an Account of my Time so precisely, as to talk of the particular Months. I will tell you. At my coming from America, I was then exact; for we set sail the fourteenth of November, and struck the first or second Day of February. So far I kept perfect Reckoning. But, after that, I was not so exact: Tho' I kept it as well as my Perplexity would admit even then, 'till the Days shortning upon me, prevented it. 
Hereupon I set about making a Year for myself. I found the Duration of the comparative Darkness, or, what might with me be termed Night, in the Course of the twenty four Hours or Day, gradually encreased for six Months; after which it decreased reciprocally, for an equal Time, and the lighter part of the Day took it's turn, as in our Parts of the World, only inversely: so that, as the Light's Decrease 
[Page 182]
became sensible about the middle of March, it was at the greatest Pitch the latter end of August, or beginning of September; and from thence, on the contrary, went on decreasing to the close of February, when I had the longest Portion of Light. Hereupon, dividing my Year, into two Seasons only, I began the Winter half in March, and the Summer half in September. Thus my Winter was the Spring and Summer Quarters of us in Europe, and my Summer those of our Autumn and Winter. 
From my settling this Matter, I kept little Account of Days or Weeks, but only reckoned my Time by Summer and Winter: so that I am pretty right as to the Revolutions of these; tho' the Years, as to their Notation, I kept no Account of, nor do I know what Year of the Lord it now is. 
Chap. XIX. 

Wilkin's Concern about Cloathing for Pedro his eldest Son; his Discourse with his Wife about the Ship; her Flight to it; his melancholy Reflections 'till her Return; an Account of what she had done, and of what she brought; she cloaths her Children, and takes a second Flight. 
As my Boy Pedro grew up, tho', as I said before, he had the Graundee, yet it was of less Dimensions than it ought to have been, 
[Page 183]
to be useful to him; so that it was visible, he could never fly; for it would scarce meet before, whereas it ought to have reached from Side to Side both ways. This pleased my Wife to the Heart; for now she was sure, whatever I had done before, I could not suspect her. Be that as it will, the Boy's Graundee not being a sufficient Vestment for him, it became necessary he should be cloathed. 
I turned over my Hoard, but could find nothing that would do; or, at least, that we knew how to fit him with. I had described my own Country Vest for Lads to Youwarkee, and she form'd a tolerable Idea of it, but we had no Tackle to alter any thing with. O my Dear, says I, had I but been born with the Graundee, I need not be now racking my Brains to get my Child Cloaths. What do you mean by that, says she? Why, says I, I would have flown to my Ship, (for I had long before related to her all my Sea Adventures, 'till the Vessel's coming to the magnetical Rock) and have brought some such Things from thence, as you, not wanting them in this Country, can have no Notion of. She seemed mighty inquisitive, to understand how a Ship was made, what it was most like to, how a Person who never saw one might know it only by the Description, and how one might get into it; with Abundance of the like Questions. 
[Page 184]
She then inquired, what sort of things those Needles and several other Utensils were, which I had at times been speaking of; and in what part of a Ship they usually kept such Articles. And I, to gratify her Curiosity, as I perceived she took a Pleasure in hearing me, answered all her Questions to a Scruple: not then conceiving the secret Purpose of all this Inquisitiveness. 
About two Days after this, having been out two or three Hours in the Morning, to cut Wood; at coming Home I found Pedro crying, ready to break his Heart, and his little Brother Tommy, hanging to him, and crawling about the Floor after him: the youngest (pretty Baby) was fast asleep upon one of the Beast Fish Skins, in a Corner of the Room. I asked Pedro for his Mother, but the poor Infant had nothing further to say to the Matter, than Mammy run away, I cry, Mammy run away, I cry. I admired where she was gone, never before missing her from our Habitation. However, I waited patiently 'till Bed-time, but no Wife. I grew very uneasy then. Yet, as my Children were tired and sleepy, I thought I had best go to Bed with them, and make quiet. So, giving all three their Suppers, we lay down together. They slept; but my Mind was too full to permit the Closure of my Eyes. A thousand different Chimeras swam in my Imagination relating to my Wife. One while I fancied her carried away by her 
[Page 185]
Kinsfolks; then, that she was gone of her own accord to make Peace with her Father. But that thought would not six, being put aside by her constant Tenderness to her Children, and Regard to me; whom I was sure she would not have left without Notice. But alass! says I, she may even now be near me, but taken so ill she can't get Home; or, she may have dyed suddenly, in the Wood. I lay tumbling and tossing in great Anxiety, not able to find out any excusable Occasion she could have, of so long Absence. And then, thinks I, if she should either be dead, or have quite left me, which will be of equally bad Consequence to me, what can I do with three poor helpless Infants. If they were a little more grown up, they might be helpful to me, and to each other; but at their Age, how shall I ever rear them, without the Tenderness of a Mother: And to see them pine away before my Face, and not know how to help them, will distract me. 
Finding I could neither Sleep, or lye still, I rose, intending to search all the Woods about, and call to her, that if any Accident had prevented Sight of her, she might at least hear me. But upon opening the Door, and just stepping out, how agreeably was I surprized, to meet her coming in, with something on her Arm. My dear Youwarkee, says I, where have you been? What has befallen you to keep you out so long? The 
[Page 186]
poor Children have been at their Wit's end to find you; and I, my Dear, have been unconsolable; and was now, almost distracted, coming in search of you. 
Youwarkee looked very blank, to think what Concern she had given me the Children. My dearest Peter, says she, (kissing me) pray forgive the only thing I have ever done to offend you, and the last Cause you shall ever have, by my good Will, to complain of me; but walk within Doors, and I will give you a farther Account of my Absence. Don't you remember what delight I took the other Day to hear you talk of your Ship? Yes, says I, you did so, but what of that? Nay, pray, says she, forgive me for I have been to see it. That's impossible, says I: And truly this was the first time I ever thought she went about to deceive me. I do assure you, says she, I have; and a wonderful Thing it is; but if you distrust me, and what I say, I have brought Proof of it; step out with me to the Verge of the Wood, and satisfy yourself. But pray, says I, who presented you with this upon your Arm? I vow, says she, I had forgot this; yes, this will, I believe, confirm to you what I have said. I turn'd it over and over; and looking wishfully upon her, says I, this Waistcoat, indeed, is the very fellow to one that lay in the Captain's Locker, in the Cabbin. Say not the very fellow, says she, but rather say the very 
[Page 187]
same; for I'll assure you it is so; and had you been with me, we might have got so many things for ourselves and the Children, we should never have wanted more, tho' we lived these hundred Years; but as it is, I have left something without the Wood, for you to bring up. When we had had our Talk out, she hearing the Children stir, took them up, and was going, as she always did, to get their Breakfasts. Hold, says I, this Journey must have fatigued you too much already, lay yourself to Rest, and leave every thing else to me. My Dear, says she, you seem to think this Flight tiresome, but you are mistaken; I am more weary with Walking to the Lake and back again, than with all the Rest. Oh, says she, if you had but the Graundee, flying would rest you, after the greatest Labour; for the Parts which are moved with Exercise on the Earth, are all at Rest in Flight; as, on the contrary, the Parts used in Flight are, when on earthly Travel. The whole Trouble of Flight is, in mounting from the plain Ground; but when once you are upon the Graundee, at a proper Height, all the rest is Play, a meer Trifle; you need only think of your Way, and incline to it, your Graundee directs you as readily as your Feet obey you on the Ground, without thinking of every Step you take: it does not require Labour, as your Boat does, to keep you a going. 
After we had composed ourselves, we walked 
[Page 188]
to the Verge of the Wood, to see what Cargo my Wife had brought from the Ship. I was astonished at the Bulk of it; and seeing, by the outside, it consisted of Cloaths, I took it, with much ado, upon my Shoulders, and carried it Home. But upon opening it, I found far more Treasure than I could have imagined: for there was a Hammer, a great many Spikes and Nails, three Spoons, about five Plates of Pewter, four Knives and a Fork, a small China Punch Bowl, two Chocolate Cups, a Paper of Needles, and several of Pins, a Parcel of coarse Thread, a pair of Shoes, and Abundance of such other things as she had heard me Wish for and Describe; besides as much Linnen and Woollen, of one Sort or another, as made a good Package for all the other things; with a great Tin Porridge Pot, of about two Gallons, tyed to the outside: and all these as nicely stowed, as if she had been bred a Packer. 
When I had viewed the Bundle, and poized the Weight; how was it possible, my dear Youwarkee, said I, for you to bring all this? You could never carry them in your Hands. No, no, replied she, I carried them on my Back. Is it possible says I, for your Graundee to bear yourself and all this Weight too, in the Air, and to such an Height as the Top of these Rocks? You will always, replies she, make the Height a part of your Difficulty in flying; but you are deceived; 
[Page 189]
for as the first Stroke, (I have heard you say often) in Fighting, is half the Battle, so it is in Flying; get but once fairly on the Wind, nothing can hurt you afterwards. My Method, let me tell you, was this: I clim'd to the highest part of the Ship, where I could stand clear, having first put up my Burthen, which you have there; and then, getting that on my Back, near my Shoulders, I took the two Cords you see hang loose to it, in my two Hands, and extending my Graandee, leaped off, flatwise, with my Face towards the Water; when, instantly, playing two or three good Strokes with my Graundee, I was out of Danger: Now, if I had found the Bundle too heavy to make my first Strokes with, I should directly have turned on my Back, dropped my Bundle, and floated in my Graundee to the Ship again, as you once saw me float on the Lake. Says I, you must have flown a prodigious Distance to the Ship, for I was several Days sailing, I believe three Weeks, from my Ship, before I reached the Gulph; and after that, could be little less than five Weeks, (as I accounted for it) and at a great Rate of Sailing too, under the Rock, before I reached the Lake; so that the Ship must be a monstrous Way off. No, no, says she, your Ship lies but over yon Cliff, that rises as it were with two Points; and as to the Rock itself, it is not broader than our Lake is long: But what made 
[Page 190]
you so tedious in your Passage was, many of the windings and turnings in the Cavern returning into themselves again; so that you might have gone round and round 'till this time, if the Tide had not luckily struck you into the direct Passage: This, says she, I have heard from some of my Countrymen, who have flown up it, but could never get quite thro'. 
I wish with all my Heart, says I, Fortune had brought me first to Light in this Country; or (but for your Sake I could almost say) had never brought me into it at all: For, to be a Creature of the least Significancy of the whole Race about one, is a melancholy Circumstance. Fear not, says she, my Love, for you have a Wife will hazard all for you, tho' you are restrained: And as my Inclinations and Affections are so much yours, that I need but know your Desires, to execute them, as far as my Power extends; surely you, who can act by another, may be content to forego the Trouble of your own Performance. I perceive, indeed, continued she, you want mightily to go to your Ship, and are more uneasy, now you know it is safe, than you was before; but that being past my Skill to assist you in, if you will command your Deputy, to go backwards and forwards in your stead, I am ready to obey you. 
Thus ended our Conversation about the Ship for that time. But it left not my Mind so soon; 
[Page 191]
for a stronger Hankering after it pursued me now than ever, since my Wife's Flight; but to no purpose. 
We sat us down, and sorted out our Cargo, Piece by Piece; and having found several things proper for the Children, my Wife longed to enter upon some piece of Work towards Cloathing Pedro, in the Manner she had heard me talk of; and laid hard at me, to shew her the Use of the Needles, Thread, and other things she had brought. Indeed, I must say, she proved very tractable; and from the little Instruction I was able to give her, soon outwrought my Knowledge: For I could only shew her that the Thread went thro' the Needle, and both thro' the Cloth to hold it together; but for anything else I was as ignorant as she. In much less Time than I could have imagined, she had cloathed my Son Pedro, and had made a sort of Mantle for the youngest. But now, seeing us so smart, (for I took upon me sometimes to wear the green Waistcoat she had brought, under my dirty Jacket) she began to be ashamed of herself, as she said, in our fine Company; and afterwards (as I shall soon acquaint you) got into our Fashion. 
Seeing the Advantages of her Flight to the Ship, and that so many Conveniencies arose from it, she was frequently at me to let her go again. I should as much have wished for another Return of Goods, as she, but I could by no Means think of 
[Page 192]
parting with my Factor; for I knew her Eagerness to please me, and that she would stick at nothing to perform it; and, thinks I, should any Accident happen to her, by over loading, or otherwise, and I should lose her, all the other Commodities of the whole World put together would not compensate her Loss. But as she so earnestly desired it, and assured me she would run no hazards, I was prevailed on at length, by her incessant Importunities, to let her go; tho' under certain Restrictions, which she promised me to comply with. As first, I insisted upon it, that she should take a Tour quite round the Rock; setting out the same way I had last gone with my Boat; and, if possible, find out the Gulph, which I told her she could not mistake, by Reason of the Noise the Fall of the Water made; and desired her to remark the Place, so as I might know, within Side, where it was without. And then, I told her, she might review and search every Hole in the Ship as she pleas'd; and if there were any small things she had a Mind to bring from it, she was welcome, provided the Bundle she should make up, was not above a fourth part either of the Bulk or Weight of the last. All which, she having engaged punctually to observe, she bid me not expect her 'till I saw her, and she would return as soon as possible. I then went with her to the Confines of the Wood, (for I told her I 
[Page 193]
desired to see her mount) and she, after we had embraced, bidding me to stand behind her, took her Flight. 
Chap. XX. 

The Author observes her Flight; a Description of a Glumm in the Graundee; she finds out the Gulph, not far from the Ship; brings Home more Goods; makes her a Gown by her Husband's Instruction. 
I had ever since our Marriage been desirous of seeing Youwarkee fly, but this was the first Opportunity I had of it; and indeed the Sight was worthy of all the Attention I paid it; for I desired her, slowly, to put herself in proper Order for it, that I might make my Observation the more accurately; and shall now give you an Account of the whole Apparatus: Tho' several Parts of the Description were taken from subsequent Views; for it would have been impossible to have made just Remarks of every thing at that once, especially as I only view'd her back Parts then. 
I told you before, I had seen her Graundee open, and quite extended, as low as her Middle; but that being in the Grotto, by Lamplight, I could not take so just a Survey as now, when the Sort of Light we ever had was at the brightest. 

[Page 194]
She first threw up two long Branches or Ribbs of the Whalebone, as I called it before, (and indeed, for several of its Properties, as Toughness, Elasticity, and Plyableness, nothing I have ever seen can so justly be compared to it) which were jointed behind to the upper Bone of the Spine, and which, when not extended, lye bent over the Shoulders, on each side of the Neck forwards, from whence, by nearer and nearer Approaches, they just meet at the lower Rim of the Belly, in a sort of Point; * 11 but when Extended, they stand their whole Length above the Shoulders, not perpendicularly, but spreading outwards, with a Webb of the softest and most plyable and springy Membrane, that can be imagined, in the Interspace between them, reaching from their Root or Joint on the Back, up above the hinder part of the Head, and near half way their own length; ‡ 12 but, when closed, the Membrane falls down in the Middle, upon the Neck, like an Handkerchief. † 13 There are also two other Ribs, rising as it were from the same Root, which, when open, run horizontally, but not so long as the others. || 14 These are filled up, in the Interspace between them and the upper ones, with the same Membrane; and on the lower Side of this is also a deep Flap of the Membrane, so that the Arms can be either above 
[Page 195]
or below it in Flight; and are always above it when closed. This last Rib, when shut, flaps under the upper one, and also falls down with it before, to the Waist, but is not join'd to the Ribs below. Along the whole Spine-bone runs a strong flat broad grisly Cartilage, to which are join'd several other of these Ribs; all which open horizontally, and are filled in the Interspaces with the above Membrane, and are jointed to the Ribs of the Person just where the Plane of the Back begins to turn towards the Breast and Belly; and, when shut, wrap the Body round to the Joints on the contrary Side, folding neatly one Side over the other. At the lower Spine are two more Ribs, extended horizontally when open, jointed again to the Hips, and long enough to meet the Joint on the contrary side cross the Belly; and from the Hip Joint, which is on the outermost Edge of the Hip-Bone, runs a plyable Cartilage quite down the outside of the Thigh and Leg to the Ancle; from which there branch out divers other Ribs, horizontally also, when open, but when closed they encompass the whole Thigh and Leg, rolling inwards, cross the back of the Leg and Thigh, till they reach and just cover the Cartilage. The Interspaces of these are also filled up with the same Membrane. From the two Ribs which join to the lower Spine-bone there hangs down a sort of short Apron, very full of Plaits, 
[Page 196]
from Hip Joint to Hip Joint, and reaches below the Buttocks, half way or more to the Hams. * 15 This has also several small limber Ribs in it. Just upon the lower Spine-Joint, and above the Apron, as I call it, there are two other long Branches, which, when close, extend upon the Back, from the point they join at below to the Shoulders, where each Rib has a Clasper, which, reaching over the Shoulders, just under the Fold of the uppermost Branch or Ribs, hold up the two Ribs flat to the Back, like a V; † 16 the Interspaces of which are also filled up with the aforesaid Membrane. This last piece, in flight, falls down almost to the Ancles || 17 ; where the two Claspers, lapping under each Leg, within side, hold it very fast; and then also the short Apron is drawn up, by the strength of the Ribs in it, between the Thighs forward, and covers the Pudenda and Groin, as far as the Rim of the Belly. ‡ 18 The whole Arms are covered also from the Shoulders to the Wrist with the same delicate Membrane, fastened to Ribs, of proportionable Dimensions, and jointed to a Cartilage on the outside, in the same Manner as on the Legs. 
It is very surprizing to feel the Difference of these Ribs when open, and when closed; for, 
[Page 197]
closed, they are as plyable as the finest Whale-bone, or more so, but, when extended, are as strong and stiff as a Bone. They are tapering, from the Roots; and are broader or narrower, as best suits the Places they occupy and the Stress they are put to, up to their Points: which are almost as small as a Hair. The Membrane between them is the most elastic thing I ever met with; occupying no more Space, when the Ribs are closed, than just from Rib to Rib, as flat and smooth as possible; but, when extended, in some Postures, will dilate itself surprizingly. This will be better comprehended by the Plates, as to the Machinery, where you will see several Figures of Glumms and Gawrys in different Attitudes, than can be exprest by Words. 
As soon as my Wife had expanded the whole Graundee, being upon plain Ground, she stooped forward, moving with a heavy rigling motion at first, which put me into some Pain for her: but after a few Strokes, beginning to rise a little, she cut thro' the Air like Lightning; and was soon over the Edge of the Rock, and out of my Sight. 
It is the most amazing thing in the World to observe the large Expansion of this Graundee, when open; and when closed, (as it all is in a Moment, upon the Party's descent) to see it sit so close and compact to the Body, as no Taylor can come up to it; and then the several Ribs lye 
[Page 198]
so justly disposed in the several Parts, that instead of being, as one would imagine, a Disadvantage to the Shape, they make the Body and Limbs look extreamly elegant; and by the different Adjustment of their Lines, on the Body and Limbs, the whole, to my Fancy, somewhat resembles the Dress of the old Roman Warriors, in their Buskins; and to Appearance seems much more noble than any factitious Garb I ever saw, or can frame a Notion of to myself. 
Tho' these People, in height, shape, and limb, very much resemble the Europeans, there is yet this Difference; that their Bodies are rather broader and flatter, and their Limbs, tho' as long, and well shaped, are seldom so thick as ours: And this I observed generally in all I saw of them, during a long time among them afterwards: But their Skin, for Beauty and Fairness, exceeds ours very much. 
My Wife having now taken her second Flight, I went home, and never left my Children 'till her Return. This was three Days after our parting. I was in Bed, with my little ones, when she knocked at the Door. I soon let her in, and we received each other with a glowing welcome. The News she brought me was very agreeable. She told me, she first went and pryed into every Nook in the Ship; where she had seen such things, could we get at them, as would make us very happy. Then she set out the way I told 
[Page 199]
her to go, in order to find the Gulph. She was much afraid she should not have discovered it, tho' she flew very slow, that she might be sure to hear the Water-fall, and not over shoot it. It was long 'ere she came at it; but, when she did, she perceiv'd she might have spared most of her Trouble, had she set out the other way; for after she had flown almost round the Island, and not before, she began to hear the Fall, and upon coming up to it, found it to be not above six Minutes flight from the Ship. She said, the Entrance was very narrow, and, she thought, lower than I represented it; for she could scarce discern any Space between the Surface of the Water and the Arch-way of the Rock. I told her, that might happen from the rise or fall of the Sea itself. But I was glad to hear the Ship was no farther from the Gulph; for my Head was never free from the thoughts of my Ship and Cargoe. She then told me, she had left a small Bundle for me without the Wood, and went to look after her Children. I brought up the Bundle: And tho' it was not near so large as the other, I found several useful things in it, wrapped up in four or five Yards of dark blue Woollen Cloth, which I knew no Name for, but which was thin and light, and about a Yard wide. I asked her where she met with this Stuff? She answered, where there was more of it, under a thing like our Bed, in a Cloth like our Sheet, which she cut open, and 
[Page 200]
took it out of. Well, says I, and what will you do with this? Why, I will make me a Coat, like yours, says she, for I don't like to look different from my dear Husband and Children. No Youwarkee, replied I, you must not do so; if you make such a Jacket as mine, there will be no Distinction between Glumm and Gawry * 19 ; the Gawren Praavet † 20 , in my Country, would not on any Account go dressed like a Glumm; for they wear a fine flowing Garment, called a Gown, that sits tight about the Waist, and hangs down from thence in folds, like your Barras ‡ 21 , almost to the Ground, so that you can hardly discern their Feet, and no other part of their Body but their Hands and Face, and about as much of their Necks and Breasts as you shew in your Graundee. 
Youwarkee seemed highly delighted with this new fancied Dress, and worked Day and Night at it, against the cold Weather. Whilst she employed herself thus, I was busied in providing my Winter Stores; which I was forced to do alone now, herself and Children taking up all my Wife's time. About a Fortnight after she had began Mantuamaking, she presented herself to me one Day, as I came from Work, in her new Gown. And truly, considering the scanty Description I 
[Page 201]
had given her of such a Garment, it appeared a good comely Dress. Tho' it had not one Plait about the Body, it sat very tight thereto, and yet hung down full enough for a Countess: for she would have put it all in, all the Stuff she had, had there been as much more of it. I could see no Opening before, so asked her how she got it on. She told me, she laid along on the Ground, and crept thro' the Plaits at the Bottom, and sewed the Body round her, after she had got her Hands and Arms thro' the Sleeves. I wondered at her Contrivance, and smiling, shew'd her how she should put it on, and also how to Pin it before; and after she had done that, and I had turned up about half a Yard of Sleeve, which then hung down to her Fingers Ends, I kissed her, and called her my Country Woman, of which and her new Gown she was very proud for a long time. 
CHAP. XXI. 

The Author gets a Breed of Poultry, and by what means; builds them an House; how he managed to keep them in Winter. 
One Day as I was traversing the Woods, to view my Bird-traps, looking into the Underwood, among the great Trees on my 
[Page 202]
right Hand, I saw a Wood Hen (a Bird I used to call so, from its Resemblance in Make to our English Poultry) come out of a little Thicket. I know not whether my Rustling, or what, had disturbed it, but I let her pass, and she ran away before me. When she was fairly out of sight, I stepped up, and found she had a Nest and sixteen Eggs there. I exactly marked the Place; and taking away one of the Eggs, I broke it, at some distance from the Nest, to see how forward they were; and I had no sooner broke the Shell, but out came a young Chicken. I then looked into the Nest again, and taking up more of the Eggs, I found them all just splintered in the Shell, and ready for Hatching. I had immediately a Desire to save them, and bring them up tame; but I was afraid if I took them away before they were hatched, and a little strengthened under the Hen, they would all dye, so I let them remain 'till next Day. In the mean while I prepared some small Netting, of such a proper Size, as I conceived would do; and with this I contrived, by fastning it to Stakes which I fixed in the Ground, to surround the Nest, and me on the outside of it. All the while I was doing this the Hen did not stir, so that I thought she had either been absent when I came, or had hatched and gone off with the young ones. As to her being gone, I was under no Concern, for I had no Design to catch her, 
[Page 203]
but only to confine the Chickens within my Net, if they were hatched. But however I went nearer, and peeping in, found she sat still, squeezing herself as flat to the Ground as she could. I was in twenty Minds whether to take her first, and then catch the Chickens, or to let her go off, and then clap upon them; but as I proposed to let her go, I thought, if she would sit still 'till I had got the Chickens, that would be the best Way. So I softly kneeled down before her, and sliding my Hand under her, I gently drew out two, and put 'em in a Bag I had in my left Hand. I then dipped again and again, taking two every turn. But going a fourth time, as I was bringing out my Prize, the Hen jumped up, slew out, and made such a Noise, that tho' I the Minute before saw six or seven more Chicks in a Lump, where she had sat, and kept my Eye upon them, yet, before I could put the last two I had got into my Bag, these were all gone, and in three Hours search I could not find one of them; tho' I was sure they could not pass my Net, and must be within the compass of a small Room, my Toils inclosing no more: After tiring myself with looking for them, I marched home with those eight I had got. 
I told Youwarkee what I had done, and how I intended to manage the little Brood, and, if I could, to bring them up tame. We kept them some Days very warm, by the Fire, and 
[Page 204]
fed them often, as I had seen my Mother do with her early Chickens; and in a Fortnight's time they were as stout and familiar as common Poultry. We kept them a long while in the House; and when I fed them I always used them to a particular Whistle, which I also taught my Wife, that they might know both us and their feeding time; and in a very short while they would come running upon the usual Sound, like Barn-door Fowls to the Name of Biddy. 
There happened in this Brood to be five Hens and three Cocks; and they were now so tame, that, having cut their Wings, I let them out, when the Weather favoured, at my Door; where they would pick about in the Wood, and get best part of their Subsistance; and having used them to roost in a Corner of my Antichamber, they all came in very regularly at Night, and took their places. My Hens, at the usual Season, laid me abundance of Eggs, and hatched me a Brood or two, each, of Chickens; so that now I was at a Loss to know what to do with them, they were become so numerous. The Antichamber was no longer a proper Receptacle of such a Flock, and therefore I built a little House, at a small Distance from my own, on purpose for their Reception and Entertainment. I had by this time cleared a Spot of Ground, on one side of my Grotto, by burning up the Timber and Underwood which had covered it; 
[Page 205]
this I inclos'd, and within that Inclosure I raised my Aviary; and my Poultry thrived well there, seem'd to like their Habitation, and grew very fat. 
My Wife and I took much Delight in visiting and feeding 'em, and it was a fine Diversion also to my Boys; but at the end of Summer, when all the other Birds took their annual Flight, away went every one of my new raised Brood with them, and one of my old Cocks, the rest of the old set remaining very quiet with me all the Winter. The next Summer, when my Chicks of that Year grew up a little, I cut their Wings, and by that Means preserved all but one; which I suppose was either not cut so close as the rest, or his Wings had grown again. From this Time I found by long Experience, that not two, out of an hundred that had once wintered with me, would ever go away, tho' I did not cut their Wings; but all of the same Season would certainly go off with the Wild ones, if they could any ways make a Shift to fly. I afterwards got a Breed of black Necks; which was a Name I gave them from the peculiar Blackness of their Necks, let the rest of their Bodies be of what Colour they would, as they were indeed of all Colours. These Birds were as big or bigger than a Turkey, of a delicious Flavour, and were bred from Turkey Eggs, hatched under my own Wood Hens, in great plenty. I was forced to 
[Page 206]
clip these, as I did the other young Fowl, to keep 'em; and at length they grew very tame, and would return every Night during the dark Season. The greatest Difficulty now was, to get Meat for all these Animals, in the Winter, when they would sit on the Roost two Days together, if I did not call and feed them; which I was sometimes forced to do by Lamp-light, or they would have starved in cloudy Weather. But I overcame that want of Food by an accidental Discovery; for I observ'd my Blacknecks, in the Woods, jump many times together at a sort of little round Heads or Pods, very dry, which hung plentifully upon a Shrub that grew in great Abundance there. I cut several of these Heads, and carrying them home with me broke them, and took out a Spoonful or more from each Head of small yellow Seeds; which giving to my Poultry, and finding they greedily devoured them, I soon laid in a Stock for twice my Number of Mouths; so that they never after wanted. I tried several times to raise a breed of Water Fowl, by hatching their Eggs under my Hens; but not one in ten of the Sorts, when hatched, were fit to eat; and those that were, would never live and thrive with me, but got away to the Lake, I having no sort of Water nearer me: so I dropped my Design of Water Fowl as impracticable. But by breeding and feeding my Land Fowl so constantly in my 
[Page 207]
Farm-Yard, I never wanted of that sort at my Table; where we eat abundance of them: for my whole side of the Lake, in a few Years, was like a Farm-Yard, so full of Poultry, that I never knew my Stock; and upon the usual Whistle they would flock round me from all Quarters. I had every thing now but Cattle, not only for the Support, but Convenience and Pleasure of Life; and so happily should I have fared here, if I had had but a Cow and Bull, a Ram and Sheep, that I would not have changed my Dominions for the Crown of England 
CHAP. XXII. 

Reflections on Mankind; the Author wants to be with his Ship; projects going, but perceives it impracticable; Youwarkee offers her Service, and goes; an Account of her Transactions on Board; Remarks on her Sagacity; she dispatches several Chests of Goods through the Gulph to the Lake; an Account of a Danger she escaped; the Author has a Fit of Sickness. 
Strange is the Temper of Mankind, who, the more they enjoy, the more they covet. Before I received any Return from my Ship, I rested tolerably easy, and but seldom thought upon what I had left behind me in her; thinking myself happy in what I had, and compleatly so, 
[Page 208]
since my Union with my dear Wife. But after I had got what I could never have expected, I grew more and more perplexed for want of the rest; and thought I should never enjoy true Happiness while even a Plank of the Ship remained. My Head, be I where I would, or at what I would, was ever on board. I wished for her in the Lake, and could I but have got her thither, I thought I should be an Emperor. And tho' I wanted for nothing to maintain Life, and had so good a Wife and five Children I was very fond of; yet the one thing I had not, reduced the Comfort of all the rest to a scanty Pattern, even so low as to destroy my whole Peace. I was even mad enough to think of venturing up the Cavern again, but was restrained from the Attempt by the certain impracticableness of it. Then I thought Youwarkee should make another trip to the Ship: But what can she bring from it, says I to myself, in respect of what must be left behind? Her whole Life won't suffice to clear it in, at the Rate she can fetch the Loading hither, in Parcels. At last a Project started; that as there were so many Chests on Board, Youwarkee should fill some of them, and send them thro' the Gulph, to take their Chance for the Lake. This, at first Sight, seemed feasable; but then I considered, how they could be got from the Ship to the Gulph; and, again, that they 
[Page 209]
would never keep out the Water, and if they fill'd, with a lading in them, they would sink; or, if this did not happen, they might be dashed to pieces against the Craggs in the Cavern. These Apprehensions stopped me again; 'till, unwilling to quit the thought, true, says I, this may happen to some, but if I get but one in five, it is better than nothing. Thus It urned and wound the Affair in my Mind; but Objections still started, too obstinate to be conquered. 
In the height of my Soliloquy, in comes Youwarkee; and seeing my dejected Look, would needs know the meaning of it. I told her plainly, that I could get no rest from Day to Day, ever since she first went to the Ship, to think such a number of good Things lay there, to be a Prey to the Sea, as the Ship wasted, when they might be of such infinite Service here; and that since her last Flight I had suffered the more, when I thought how near the Gulph was to the Ship: So that could I but get thither myself, with my Boat, I would contrive to pack up the Goods in the Chests that were on Board, and, carrying them in the Boat, drop them near the Draft of the Water, which of itself would suck them under the Rock, down the Gulph; and when they were passed thro' the Cavern, I might take them up in the Lake. Well, says she, Peter, and why can't I do this for you? 
[Page 210]
No, says I, even this has its Objections. Then I told her what I feared of their taking Water, or dashing against the Rock, and twenty other ways of frustrating my Views; but above all, says I, how can you get such large and weighty things to the Gulph without a Boat? There is another Impossibility! it won't do. 
Youwarkee eyed me attentively. Prithee, my dear Peter, says she, set your Heart at rest about that. I can only try; if no good is to be done, you shall soon know it, and must rest contented under the Disappointment. I told her, if I was there, I could take all the Things out of a Chest, and then melt some Pitch, and pour into every Crack, to keep out the Water, when they were set a Float. Pitch, says she, what's that? Why, says I, that is a nasty, hard, black, sticking thing, that stands in Tubs in the Ship; and which, being put over the Fire, in any thing to melt, will grow liquid; and, when it is cold, be hard again; and will resist the Water and keep it out. Says she, how can I put this Pitch within side of the Chest lid, when I have tyed it up? It is to no manner of purpose, says I, to talk of it, so there's an end of it. But, says she, suppose yourself there, what Things would you bring first? I then entered into a long detail of Particulars, saying, I would have this and that, and so on, 'till I had scarce left out a Thing I either knew of or could suppose to be in the Ship; 
[Page 211]
and for fear I had not mentioned all, says I, at last, if I was there, I believe I should leave but little portable behind me. 
So, so, my dear, says Youwarkee, you would roll in Riches, I find, but you have mentioned never a new Gown for me. Why ay, says I, I would have that too. But how would you melt the Pitch? says she. O, says I, there is a Tinder-Box and Matches, in a Room below, upon the side of the Fire Hearth; and then I let her see one I had brought with me, and shew'd her the Use of the Flint and Steel. Well, my Dear, says she, will you once more trust me? I told her, her going would be of little more Use than to get a second Gown, or some such thing; but if she was desirous, I would let her make another Flight, on her Promise to be back as soon as possible. 
In the Evening she set out, and stayed two Days, and 'till the Night of the third. I would here observe, that tho' it was much lighter and brighter on the outside of the Rock, where the Ship lay, than with us at Graundevolet, yet, having always her Spectacles with her, I heard no more complaint of the Glare of Light she used to be so much afraid of: Indeed she always avoided the Fire and Lamp at home, as much as she could; because she generally took off her Spectacles within Doors; but when at any time she had them on, she could bear both well enough. 

[Page 212]
Upon her Return again, she told me she had shipped some Goods to Sea for me, which she hoped would arrive safe, (for by this time, she had had my seafaring so often over, she could apply them very properly) and that they were in six Chests, which she had pitched after my Directions. Ay, says I, you have pitched them into the Sea, perhaps, but after my Directions, I am satisfied, was beyond your Ability. You Glumms, says she, think us Gawrys very ignorant, but I'll satisfy you we are not so dull of Apprehension as you would make us; did not you show me, one Day, how your Boat was tarred and caulked, as you call it? I did, says I, what then? I'll tell you, says she. When I had emptied the first Chest, and set it properly, I looked about for your Pitch, which, at last, I found by it's sticking to my Fingers; I then put a good Piece into a sort of a little Kettle, with a long Handle, that lay upon the Pitch. --O, the Pitch Ladle, says I. -I know not what you call it, says she, but then I made a Fire, as you told me, and melted that Stuff; afterwards turning up the Chest sideways, and then endways, I poured it into it, and let it settle in the Cracks, and with an old Stocking, such as yours, dipped into the Pitch, I rubbed every place where the Boards joined. I then set the Chest on the side of the Ship, and when the Pitch was cold and hardned in it, filled it top full of things. But 
[Page 213]
when I had done thus, and shut the Lid, I found that would not come so close, but I could get the Blade of a Knife thro', any where between it and the Chest; whereupon, I cut some long Slips of the Cloth I was packing up, and fitting them all round the Edge of the Chest, I dipped them into the Pitch, and laid them on hot; and where one Slip would not do, I put two; and shutting the Lid down close upon them, I nailed it, as I had seen you do some things, quite round; then tying a Rope to the Handle, I tipped the Chest into the Sea, holding the Rope; I watched it some time, and seeing it swim well, I took flight, with the Rope in my Hand, and drew the Chest after me to the Gulph, when, letting go the Rope, away it went. I served five more in the same Manner. And now, my dearest, I am here to tell you, I hope you will be able to see at least some of them, one time or other, in the Lake. 
I admired in all this at the Sagacity of the Gawrys. Alas! thinks I, what narrow hearted Creatures are Mankind? Did not I heretofore look upon the poor Blacks in Africa as little better than Beasts, 'till my friend Glandlipze convinced me, by disabling the Crocodile, the Passage of the River, and several other Atchievements, that my own Excellencies might have perished in a Desert, without his Genius; and now what could I, or almost any of us 
[Page 214]
Master-pieces of the Creation (as we think ourselves) and Heavens peculiar Favourites have done, in this present Case, that has been omitted by this Woman, (for I may justly stile her so in an eminent Degree) and that in a way to which she was bred an utter Stranger. 
After what I had heard from Youwarkee, I grew much more cheerful; which she (poor Creature) was remarkably pleased with. She went with me constantly once, and sometimes twice, a Day, for several Days together, to see what Success at the Lake; 'till at length she grew very impatient, for fear, as she afterwards told me, I should either think she had not done what she said, or had done it in an ineffectual Manner. But one Day, walking by the Lake, I thought I saw something floating in the Water, at a very great Distance. Youwarkee, says I, I spy a Sail; then running to my Boat, and taking her in, away we went, plying my Oars with all my might, for I longed to see what it was. At nearer View I perceived it to be one of my Wife's Fleet. But what added to my Satisfaction, was, to see Youwarkee so pleased, for she could scarcely contain herself. 
When we came close to it, up she started; now, my dear Peter, says she, torment yourself no more about your Goods on Board, for if this will do, all shall be your own. She then lent me a Hand to take it in; but we had both 
[Page 215]
Work enough to compass it, the Wood had soaked in so much Water. We then made the best of our way homewards to my wet Dock; when, just as we had landed our Treasure, we saw two more Boxes coming down the Stream, both together; whereupon we launched again, and brought them in, one by one: For I did not care to trust them both on one Bottom, my Boat being in Years, and grown somewhat crazy. 
We had now made a good Day's Work of it; so, mooring the Boat, we went home, intending to be out next Morning early with the Cart, to convey our Imports to the Grotto. 
After Supper, Youwarkee, looking very earnestly at me, with Tears just glittering in her Eyes, broke out in these Words, What should you have thought, Peter, to have seen me come sailing, drowned, thro' the Cavern, tied to one of your Chests? Heaven forbid such a Thought! my Charmer, says I. But, as you know I must have been rendered the most miserable of all living Creatures by such a Sight, or any thing else that would deprive me of you; pray tell me how you could possibly have such a Thought in your Head? She saw she had raised my Concern, and was very sorry for what she had said. Nothing, nothing, says she, my Dear; it was only a Fancy just come into my Head. My dear Youwee, says I, you must let me know what you mean; I am in great Pain till you 
[Page 216]
explain yourself: for I am sure there is something more in what you say than Fancy; therefore, pray, if you love me, keep me on the Rack no longer. Ah! Peter, says she, there was but a Span between me and Death, not many Days ago; and when I saw the Line of the last Chest we took up just now, it gave me so much Horror, I could scarce keep upon my Feet. My Dear Youwee, proceed, says I, for I can't bear my Torment 'till I have heard the worst. Why, Peter, says she, now the Danger is over, I shall tell you my Escape, with as much Pleasure as I guess you will take in hearing of it. You must know, my Life, says she, that having cast that Chest into the Sea, as I was tugging it along, by that very Line, it being one of the heaviest, and moving but slowly, I twisted the String several times round my Hand, one Fold upon another, the easier to tow it; when, drawing it rather too quick into the Eddy, it pulled so hard against me, towards the Gulph, and so quick, that I could no way loosen or disengage the Cord from my Fingers, but was drag'd thereby to the very Rock; against which the Chest struck violently: My last Thought, as I supposed it, was of you, my Dear, (on which she clasped me round the Neck, in sense of her past Agony;) when, taking myself for lost, I forbore further Resistance; at which Instant the Line, slackning by the Rebound of the Chest, fell from my Hand of itself; 
[Page 217]
and the Chest, returning to the Rock, went down the Current. I took a Turn or two round on my Graundee, to recollect my past Danger, and went back to the Ship, fully resolved to avoid the like Snare for the future. Indeed I did not easily recover my Spirits, and was so terrify'd with the Thought, that I had half a Mind to have left the two remaining Chests behind me: But, as Danger overcome gives fresh Resolution, I again set to work, and discharged them also down the Gulph, as I hope you will see in good Time. 
My Heart bled within me all the while she spoke; and I even felt ten Times more than she could have suffered by the Gulph. My dearest Youwee, says I, why did not you tell me this Adventure sooner? It is too soon I fear now, says she; for she then saw the Colour forsake my Lips, my Eyes grow languid, and myself dropping into her Arms. She screamed out, and ran to the Chest, where all was empty; but turning every Bottle up, and, from the remaining Drops in each, collecting a small Quantity of Liquor, and putting it by little and little to my Lips, and rubbing my Wrists and Temples, she brought me to myself again: But I continued so extreamly sick for some Days after, that it was above a Week before I could get down with my Cart to fetch up my Chests. 

[Page 218]
When I was able to go down, Youwarkee would not venture me alone, but went herself with me. We then found two more of the Chests, which we landed; and I had Work sufficient for two or three Days, in getting them all up to the Grotto, they were so heavy, and all the way thro' the Wood being up Hill. 
We had five in Hand, and watched several Days for the sixth, when seeing nothing of it, we gave it over for lost. But one Day, as I was going for Water, Youwarkee would go with me, and urged our carrying the Net, that we might drag for some Fish. Accordingly we did so. And now having taken what we wanted, we went to the Rill, and pushing in the Head of the Boat (as I usually did, for by that means I could fill the Vessel as I stood on board) the first thing that appeared was my sixth Chest. Youwarkee spyed it first, and cry'd, pointing thereto, O Peter, what we have long wished for, and almost despaired of, is come at last; let us meet and welcome it. I was pleas'd with the Gaiety of her Fancy; I did as she desired; we got it into the Boat, after merrily saluting it, and so returned home. It took us up several Days time in searching, sorting, and disposing our Cargoe, and drying the Chests: For the Goods themselves were so far from being wetted or spoiled, that even those in the last Chest, which had lain so long in the Water, had not taken the least Moisture. 

[Page 219]
Youwarkee was quite alert at the Success of her packing, but left me to ring her Praises: which I did not fail of doing, more than once, at unpacking each Chest, and could see her Eyes glow with Delight, to see she had so pleased me. 
She had been so curious as to examine almost every thing in the Ship; and as well of Things I had described, and she did know, as of what she did not, brought me something for a Sample: But, above all, had not forgot the blue Stuff; for the moment she had seen that, she destin'd it to the Use of herself and Children. 
CHAP. XXIII. 

The Religion of the Author's Family. 
Youwarkee and I having fixed ourselves by degrees into a settled Rota of Action, began to live like Christians; having so great a Quantity of most sorts of Necessaries about us. But I say we lived like Christians, on another Account; for you must not think, after what I have said before, that I and my Family lived like Heathens: No, I'll assure you, they, by degrees, knew all I knew; and that, with a little artificial Improvement, and a well regulated Disposition, I hoped, and did not doubt, would carry them all to Heaven. I 
[Page 220]
would many a Time have given all my Interest in the Ship's Cargoe for a Bible; and a hundred Times griev'd that I was not Master of a Pocket one, which I might have carried every where about me. I never imagin'd there was one aboard; and if there were, and Youwarkee should find it, I suppos'd it would be in Portugueze, which I knew little of; so it would be of small Service to me, if I had it. 
Since I am upon the Topic of Religion, it may not be amiss, once for all, to give you a small Sketch of my religious Proceedings, after coming into my new Dominions. I have already told you, that, from my first Stop at the Rock, I had prayed constantly Morning and Evening; but I can't say I did it always with the same Efficacy. However, my imperfect Devotions were not without good Effect: And I am confident, wherever this Course is pursued with a right View, sooner or later the Issue will prove the same to others as I found it to myself: ----I mean, that Mercies will be remembred with more Gratitude, and Evils be more disregarded, and become less burthensome: And surely the Person whose Case this is, must necessarily enjoy the truest Relish of Life. As daily Prayer was my Practice, in answer to it I obtained the greatest Blessing and Comfort my Solitude was capable of receiving: I mean my Wife; whose Character I need not farther attempt 
[Page 221]
to blazon, in any faint Colours of my own, after what has been already said; her Acts having spoken her Virtues beyond all verbal Description. 
After we were married, as I call it, that is, after we had agreed to become Man and Wife, I frequently prayed before her, and with her, (for by this Time she understood a good deal of my Language;) at which, tho' contrary to my Expectation, she did not seem surprised, but readily kneeled by, and joyned with me. This I liked very well. And upon my asking her one Day, after Prayer, if she understood what I had been doing, (for I had a Notion she did not) Yes, verily, says she, you have been making Petitions to the Image of the great Collwar* 22 . Pray, says I, (willing gently to lead her into a just Sense of a supreme Being) who is this Collwar? And where does he dwell? He it is, says she, that does all Good and Evil to us. Right, says I, it is in some Measure so; but he can't of himself do Evil, absolutely and properly, as his own Act. Yes, says she, he can; for he can do all that can be done; and as Evil can be done, he can do it. So quick a Reply startled me. Thinks I, she will run me a Ground presently; and from being a Doctor, as I fancy'd myself, I shall become but a Pupil to my own Scholar. I then asked her where the great Collwar dwelt? 
[Page 222]
She told me in Heaven, in a charming Place. And can he know what we do, says I? Yes, reply'd she, his Image tells him every thing; and I have prayed to his Image, which I have often seen; and it is filled with so much Virtue, that it is his second Self: For there is only one of them in the World; who is so good, he gives several Virtues to other Images of himself, which are brought to him, and put into his Arms to breath upon; and the only thing I have ever regretted since I knew you, is, that I have not one of them here to comfort and bless us and our Children. 
Tho' I was sorry for the Oddity of her Conceptions, I was almost glad to find her so ignorant; and pleased myself with thinking, that as she had already a confused Notion of a supreme Power, I should soon have the Satisfaction of bringing her to a more rational Knowledge of him. 
Pray, Youwee, says I, what is your God made of? Why of Clay, says she, finely painted; and looks so terrible, he would make you tremble to behold him. Do you think, says I, that is the true Collwar's real Shape, if you could see himself? She told me yes; for that some of his best Servants had seen him, and took the Representation from himself. And, pray, do you think he loves his best Servants, as you call them, and is kind to them? You need not doubt it, says she. 
[Page 223]
Why then, reply'd I, how came he to look so terrible upon them, when they saw him, as you say they did? For I can see no Reason, how terrible sowever he looks to others, why he should shew himself so to those he loves. I should rather think, as you say he is kind to them, that he should have two Images, a placid one for his good, and a terrible one for his bad, Servants. Or else, who by seeing him, can tell whether he is pleased or angry? For even you yourself, Youwee, when any thing pleases you, have a different Look from that you have when you are angry; and little Pedro can tell whether he does well or ill, by your Countenance: Whereas, if you made no Distinction, but looked with the same Face on all his Actions, he would as readily think he did well as ill in committing a bad Action. Youwarkee could not tell what to say to this, the Fact seeming against her. 
I then asked her, if she thought the Image itself could hear her Petitions? She reply'd, yes. And can he, says I, return you an Answer? She told me, he only did that to his best Servants. Did you ever hear him do it? says I: For unless he can speak too, I should much suspect his hearing; and you being one of his best Servants, seeing you love him, and pray heartily to him, why should you not hear him as soon as others? No, says she, there are a great Number of Glumms on purpose to serve him, pray 
[Page 224]
for us to him, and receive his Answers. But to what Purpose then, says I, is your praying to him, if their Prayer will serve your Turn? O, says she, the Image hears them sooner than us, and sends the Petitions up to the great Collwar, and lets him know who makes them, and desires him to let them have what they want. But suppose, says I, for Arguments sake, that you could see the great Collwar, or know where he was, and should pray to himself, without going about to his Image first; do you think he could not hear you? I can't tell that, says she. But how then, says I, can he tell what (if it could speak) his Image says, which is as far from him as you are? And, pray, do you think he can hear an Image which he did not make, which could not make itself, and which can neither hear, nor see, nor speak; better than he can hear a Glumm whom he did make, and who made that Image, and who himself can hear, and see, and speak to him? She paused here a good while. At last, says she, Why, truly, I cannot think but he might as well, or better, hear me than the Image. Why then, said I, don't you make your Petitions to himself, and not to the Image? It is for the Reason I have given you, my Dear Youwarkee, that I pray to him, and not to his Image, or any Representation of him upon Earth; and, consequently, am more sure of being heard and answered. Indeed, says she, I 
[Page 225]
never thought of that before; for our Ragans * 23 always charged me to pray to the Image; or to let them know what I wanted, and they would pray to him for me; and they have had many a Rappin † 24 of me for so doing, and sometimes two or three, when they told me I should have what I wanted: But you have convinced me it is better to pray to himself, and I shall always do it hereafter. 
Having conducted my Scholar thus far, I left off, thinking I had now laid a solid Basis, that I need be in no fear for my Superstructure: And as the flower you build, the firmer it settles; I thought fit to let this first Work settle into a firm Principle, before I raised any further Doctrine upon it, which, as Occasion offered, I determined to pursue. I propagated no theological Notions in my Children, 'till they were capable of conceiving the Truth of them from Principles of Reason; but only inculcated on them Justice, Truth, and Love to myself, their Mother, and each other. Having brought my Wife firmly to believe in a supreme Being (let her call him what she would) who could hear our Prayers, see our Actions, and answer our Petitions as he sees fit; and to an Assurance that his Love to us is so great, that he will do what is most beneficial for us, tho' it should not 
[Page 226]
always prove what we think so; the great Truths, concerning his Dispensations in our Creation and Redemption, and our Duty towards him, follow'd of course, as direct Consequences of such his Love and Knowledge of us; and she easily came into 'em. Accordingly, I opened the Doctrine of the Creation to her as well as I could. I am sorry to say, my Explication of this great Point was not so just, so particular, and clear as it might have been, if I had had a Bible; any more than was the succeeding History of our Redemption: However, in general, I explained both so effectually, that tho' it required Time to ground her in the full practical Faith of it, yet the Opinion she had of me, and my Fidelity to her, with the Reasons I was able to urge for what I taught her, persuaded her I was in the Right, and disposed her to hearken to what I delivered; and then her own zealous Application, with God's Grace, soon brought her to a firm Belief in it, and a suitable Temper and Conduct with respect to God and Man. 
After I had began with my Children, I frequently referred their further Instruction to their Mother; for I have always experienced, that a superficial Knowledge, with a Desire of becoming a Teacher, is, in some Measure, equivalent to better Knowledge: For it not only excites every Principle one has to the utmost, but makes 
[Page 227]
Matters more clear and conspicuous even to oneself. 
By these Means, and the divine Blessing thereon, in a few Years, I may fairly say, I had a little Christian Church in my own House, and in a flourishing way too, without a Schismatick or Heretick amongst us. 
CHAP. XXIV. 

The Author's Account of his Children; their Names; they are exercised in Flying; his Boat crazy; Youwarkee intends a Visit to her Father, but first takes another Flight to the Ship; sends a Boat and Chests thro' the Gulph; cloaths her Children; is with Child again, so her Visit is put off; an Inventory of the last Freight of Goods; the Author's Method of treating his Children; Youwarkee, her Son Tommy, with her Daughters Patty and Hallicarnie, set out to her Father's. 
I had now lived here almost fourteen Years; and besides the three Sons before-mentioned, had three Girls and one Boy. Pedro, my eldest, had the Graundee, but too small to be useful; my second Son, Tommy, had it compleat; so had my three Daughters; but Jemmy and David, the youngest Sons, none at all. My eldest 
[Page 228]
Daughter I name Patty, because I always call'd my first Wife so: I say, my first Wife, tho' I had no other Knowledge of her Death than my Dream; but am from that as verily perswaded, if ever I reach England I shall find it so, as if I had heard it from her Aunt's own Mouth. My second Daughter my Wife desired might be call'd by her Sister's Name, Hallicarnie; and my Youngest I named Sarah, after my Mother. I put you to the Trouble of writing down the Names, for as I shall hereafter have frequent Occasion to mention the Children severally, it will be pleasanter for myself and you to call them by their several Names of Distinction, than to call them my second Son, or my eldest Daughter, and so forth. 
My Wife now took great Delight in exercising Tommy and Patty (who were big enough to be trusted) in flight, and would often skim round the whole Island with them before I could walk half thro' the Wood. And she would teach them also to swim or sail; I know not which to call it, for sometimes you should see them dart out of the Air, as if they would fall on their Faces into the Lake, when, coming near the Surface, they would stretch their Legs in an horizontal Posture, and in an Instant turn on their Backs, and then you could see nothing from the Bank, to all Appearance, but a Boat sailing along, the Graundee rising at their Head, 
[Page 229]
Feet, and Sides, so like the Sides and Ends of a Boat, that you could not discern the Face, or any Part of the Body * 25 . I own, I often envied them this Exercise, which they seemed to perform with more Ease than I could only shake my Leg, or stir an Arm. 
Tho' we had perpetually Swangeans about us, and the Voices, as I used to call them, I could never once prevail on my Wife to shew herself, or to claim any Acquaintance with her Country-folks. And what is very remarkable in my Children, is, that my three Daughters and Tommy, who had the full Graundee, had exactly their Mother's Sight, Jemmy and David had just my Sight, and Pedro's Sight was between both, tho' he was never much affected with any Light: But I was obliged to make Spectacles for Tommy and all my Daughters when they came to go abroad. 
I had in this Time twice enlarged my Dwelling, which the Encrease of my Family had rendred necessary. The last Alteration I was enabled to do in a much better Manner, and with more Ease, than the first; for, by the Return of my Flota, I had gotten a large Collection of useful Tools: Several of Iron, where the Handles or Wood-work preponderated the Iron; but such as were all, or greatest Part, of that Metal had got either to the Rock, or were so fast fixed to the Head of the Ship, that it was difficult 
[Page 230]
to remove them; so that my Wife could get comparatively few of this latter Sort; tho' some she did. It was well, truly, I had these Instruments, which greatly facilitated my Labours; for I was forced to work harder now than ever, in making Provision for us all; and my Sons Pedro and Tommy commonly assisted. I had also had another Importation of Goods thro' the Gulph, which still added to my Convenience. But my Boat made me shudder every Time I went into her. She had leaked again and again, and I had patch'd her till I could scarce see a Bit of the old Wood. She was of unspeakable Use to me, and yet I could not venture myself in her, but with the utmost Apprehension and trembling. I had been intending a good while, now I had such Helps, to build a new one, but had been diverted by one Avocation or other. 
About this Time, Youwarkee, who was now upwards of thirty-two Years of Age, the fondest Mother living, and very proud of her Children, had formed a Project of taking a Flight to Arndrumnstake, a Town in the Kingdom of Doorpt Swangeanti, as I called it, where her Father, if living, was * 26 Colamb, under Georigetti the Prince of that Country. She imparted her Desire to me, asking my Leave; and she told me, if I pleased, she would take Patty and 
[Page 231]
Tommy along with her. I did not much dislike the Proposal, because of the great Inclination I had, for a long time, to a Knowledge of, and Familiarity with, her Countrymen and Relations; and now I had so many of her Children with me, I could not think she would ever be prevailed on, but by Force, to quit me and her Offspring, and be contented to loose six for the sake of having two with her; especially as she had shewed no more Love for them than the rest: So I made no Hesitation, but told her she should go. 
I expected continually I should hear of her Departure; but she saying no more of it, I thought she had dropt her Design, and I did not chuse to mention it. But one Day, as we were at Dinner, looking mighty seriously, she said, My Dear, I have considered of the Journey you have consented I should take, but in order thereto it is necessary that I prepare several Things for the Children, especially those who have no Graundee, and I am resolved to finish them before I go, that we may appear with Decency, both here and at Arndrumnstake: For I am sure my Father, whose Temper I am perfectly acquainted with, will, upon Sight of me and my little ones, be so overjoyed, that he will forgive my Absence, and Marriage, provided he sees Reason to believe I have not match'd unworthily, unbecoming my Birth; and after keeping me 
[Page 232]
and the Children with him, it may be two or three Months, will accompany me home again himself, with a great Retinue of Servants and Relations; or, at least, if he is either dead or unable for Flight, my other Relations will come, or send a Convoy to take Care of me and the Children: And, my Dear, as I shall give them all the Encomiums I can of you, and of my Situation with you, while I am among them; I would have them a little taken with the Elegance of our domestick Condition when they come hither, that they may think me happy in you and my Children: For I would not only put my Family into a Condition to appear before them, but to surprize the old Gentleman and his Company, who never in their Lives saw any Part of Mankind with another Covering than the Graundee. When she had done, I expressed my Approbation of her whole System, as altogether prudent; and she proceeded immediately to put it in Execution. To work she went, opened every Chest, and examined their Contents. But while she was upon the hunt, and selecting such Things as she thought fit for her Purpose, she recollected several Articles she had observed in the Ship, which she judged far more for her Turn, than any she had at home. Hereupon she prayed me to let her take another Trip to the Vessel, and to carry Tommy with her. 

[Page 233]
After so many Trials, and such happy Experience of her wise and fortunate Conduct, I consented to her Flight, and away went she and her Son. Upon their Return, which was in a few Days, she told me what they had been doing, and said, as she so often heard me complain of the Age of my Boat, and fear to sail in her, she had fitted me out a little Ship, and hoped it would in due Time arrive safely. As she passed quickly on to other Things, I never once thought of asking her what she meant by the little Ship she spoke of; but must own, that like a foolishly fond Parent, I was more intent on her telling me how Tommy had found a Hoard of Playthings, which he had packed up for his own Use. 
As to this last Particular, I learn'd, by the Sequel of the Story, when the Spark, proud of his Acquisition, came to me, That he had been peeping about in the Cabin, whilst his Mother was packing the Chests, and seeing a small brass Knob in the Wainscot, took it for a Plaything, and pulling to get it out, opened a little Door of a Cupboard, where he had found some very pretty Toys, that he positively claim'd for himself: Among which were, a small plain gold Ring, and a very fine one set with Diamonds, which he shewed me upon two of his Fingers. I wondered how the Child, who had never before seen such Things, or the Use of them, should happen to 
[Page 234]
apply these so properly; but he told me, in playing with this, meaning the Diamond Ring, about his Fingers, it slipped over his middle Finger Joint, and he could not get it off again, so he put the other upon another Finger to keep it Company. 
We watched daily, as usual on such Occasions, for the Arrival of our Fleet. It was surprizing, that none of the Chests which Youwarkee shot down the Gulph were ever half so long in their Passage as I was myself, but some came in a Week, some in a few Days more, and even some in less: Which I attributed to their following directly the Course of the Water, shooting from Shelf to Shelf as the Tide set; and I believe my keeping the Boat I sailed in so strictly and constantly in the Middle of the Stream, was the Reason of my being detained there so long. In less than a Fortnight, every thing came safe but one Chest, which, as we never heard of it, I suppose was either sunk or bulged. 
Being one Day upon Shore, watching to see if any thing more was come thro' the Cavern, I spied at a Distance somewhat looking very black and very long, and by the Colour and Shape thereof I took it for a young Whale. Having observed it some Time making very little Way, I took my old Boat and followed it; but was afraid to go near it, lest a Stroke with its Tail (which I then fancied I saw move) might endanger 
[Page 235]
my Boat and myself too; but creeping nearer and nearer, and seeing it did not stir, I believed it to be dead; whereupon taking Courage, I drew so close, that at length I plainly perceived it was the Ship's second Boat turned upside down. It is not easy to express the Joy I felt on this Discovery. It was the very Thing I was now, as I have said, in the greatest Want of. I presently laid hold of it, and brought it ashore; and it was no small Pleasure to find, on examining, that tho' it had lain so long dry, it was yet quite sound, and all its Chinks filled up in its Passage: And it prov'd to me, afterwards, the most beneficial Thing I could have had from the Ship. 
I got all my Goods home from the Lake to my Grotto, by means of the Cart, as usual. My Wife and Daughters waited with Impatience for me to unpack, that they might take Possession of such Things as would be needful for rigging out the Family, against the supposed Reception of the old Glumm, and had set all the Chests in the Order they desired they might be opened in. But Tommy running to me, with a pray Daddy open my Chest first, pray give me my Playthings first, it was (to satisfy him) concluded in Favour of his Demand. So, he pointing to the Chest which he regarded as his Property, I opened it, whilst his Eyes were ready to pierce thro' it, 'till I came to his Treasure. There, there they are, Daddy, says he, 
[Page 236]
as soon as I had uncovered 'em. And indeed, when I saw them, I could not but much commend the Child for his Fancy; for the first Things that appeared were a silver Punch or Wine Can and a Ladle, then a gold Watch, a Pair of Scissars, a small silver Chaffing-dish and Lamp, a large Case of mathematical Instruments, a Flagellet, a Terrella, or globular Loadstone, a small Globe, a Dozen of large silver Spoons, and a small Case of Knives and Forks and Spoons: In short, there was, I believe, the greatest Part of the Portuguese Captain's valuable Effects. 
These Tommy claiming as his own proper Chattels, I could not help interposing somewhat of my Authority in the Affair. Hold, hold Son, says I, these Things are all mine: But as I have several of you, who will all be equally pleased with them; though, as the first Finder, you may be entitled to the best Share, you are not to grasp the Whole; you must all have something like an Equality: And as to some Things which may be equally useful to us all, they must be set up to be used upon Occasion, and are to be considered as mine and your Mother's Property. I thereupon gave each of them a large silver Spoon, and with a Fork I scratched the Initials of their Names respectively on 'em, and divided several of the Trifles amongst them equally. And now Tommy, says I, you, for your Pains, shall have this more than the rest, 
[Page 237]
offering him the Flagellet. Tommy looked very gloomy; and though he durst not find Fault, his Dissatisfaction was very visible, by cooly taking it, tossing it down, and walking gravely off. I thought, says I, Tommy, I had made a good Choice for you; but, as I find you despise it, here Pedro, do you take that pretty Thing, since your Brother slights it. Tommy replied (speaking but half out, and a little surly, more than I ever observed before) let him take it, if he will, I can get Bits of Sticks enough in the Wood. 
My Method had always been to avoid either beating or scolding at my Children, for preferring their own Opinion to mine; but I ever let Things turn about so, that from their own Reason they should perceive they had erred in opposing my Sentiments; by which means they grew so habituated to submit to my Advice and Direction, that, for the most part, my Will was no sooner known to them, than it became their own Choice: But then I never willed according to Fancy only, but with Judgment, to the best of my Skill. 
Tommy therefore (as I said before) having shewn a Disapprobation of my Doings; to convince him of his Mistake, I took the Flagellet from Pedro, and now Pedro, says I, let me teach you how to manage this Piece of Wood, as Tommy calls it, and then let me see if in all the Grove he can cut such another. On this I clapt it to my 
[Page 238]
Mouth, and immediately played several Country Dances and Hornpipes on it: For tho' my Mother had scarce taught me to read, I had learnt Musick and Dancing, being, as she called them, Gentleman-like Accomplishments. My Wife and Children, especially Tommy, all stared as if they were wild, first on me, then on one another, whilst I played a Country Dance; but I had no sooner struck up an Hornpipe, than their Feet, Arms, and Heads, had so many Twitchings and convulsive Motions, that not one quiet Limb was to be seen amongst them; till having exercised their Members as long as I saw fit, I almost laid them all to Sleep with Chevy Chase, and so gave over. 
They no sooner found themselves free from this Enchantment, than the Children all husled round me in a Cluster, all speaking together, and reaching out their little Hands to the Instrument. I gave it Pedro. There, says I to him, take this slighted Favour as no such contemptible Present. 
Poor Tommy, who had all this while looked very simple, burst into a Flood of Tears, at my last Words, as if his Heart would have broke; and running to me, fell on his Knees, and begged my Pardon, hoping I would forgive him. I took him up, and kissing him, told him he had very little offended me; for, as he knew, I had more Children to give any thing to which either 
[Page 239]
of the rest despised, it was equal to me who had it, so it was thankfully received. I found that did not satisfy: Still in Tears, he said, might he not have the Stick again, as I gave it to him first? Tommy, says I, you know I gave it to you first; but you disapproving my Kindness, I have now given it Pedro, who, should I against his Will take it from him, would have that Reason to complain which you have not, who parted with it by your own Consent; and therefore, Tommy, as I am determined to acquaint you, as near as I can, with the strict Rules of Justice, there must no more be said to me of this Matter. Such as this was my constant Practice amongst them; and they having always found me inflexible from this Rule, we seldom had any long Debates. 
Tho' I say the Affair ended so, with regard to what I had to do in it, yet it ended not so with Tommy; for tho' he knew he had no Hopes of moving me, he set all his Engines at work to recover his Stick (as he called it) by his Mother's and Sister's Interest. These solicited Pedro very strongly to gratify him. At length Pedro (he being a Boy of a most humane Disposition) granted their Desire, if I would give leave; and I having signified, that, the Cause being now out of my Hands, he might do as he pleased, he generously yielded it. And indeed he could not have bestowed it more properly; for Tommy had 
[Page 240]
the best Ear for Musick I ever knew; and in less than a Twelvemonth could far outdo me, his Instructor, in Softness and Easiness of Finger; and was also Master of every Tune I knew, which were neither inconsiderable in Number, or of the lowest Rate. 
Youwarkee, with her Daughters, sat close to Work, and had but just compleated her whole Design for the Family Cloathing when she told me she found herself with Child again. As that Circumstance ill-suited a Journey, she deferred her Flight for about fifteen Months; in which Time she was brought to Bed, and weaned the Infant, which was a Boy, whom I named Richard, after my good Master at the Academy. The little Knave thrived amain, and was left to my further Nursing during its Mammy's Absence: Who, still firm to her Resolution, after she had equipped herself and Companions with whatever was necessary to their travelling, and locked up all the Apparel she had made, till her Return, because she would have it appear new when her Father came, set out with her Son Tommy and my two Daughters Patty and Hallicarnie; the last of which, by this Time, being big enough also to be trusted with her Mother. 

[Page 241]

CHAP. XVIII. 

Youwarkee's Account of the Stages to Arndrumnstake; the Author uneasy at her Flight; his Imployment in her Absence, and Preparations for receiving her Father; how he spent the Evenings with the Children. 
My Wife was now upon her Journey to her Father's; but where that was, or how far off, it was impossible for me to conceive by her Description of the Way: For she distinguished it not by Miles or Leagues, but by Swangeans, and Names of Rocks, Seas, and Mountains, which I could neither comprehend the Distance of from each other, or from Graundevolet where I was. I understood by her indeed there was a great Sea to be passed, which would take her up almost a Day and Night, having the Children with her, before she reached the next Arkoe; though she could do it herself, she said, and strain hard, in a Summer's Night: But if the Children should flag by the Way, as there was no Resting-place between us and Battringdrigg, the next Arkoe, it might be dangerous to them; so she would take the above Time for their Sakes. After this, I found by what she said, there was a narrow Sea to pass, and a prodigious Mountain, before she reached her own Country; and that her Father's was but a little beyond that Mountain. This 
[Page 242]
was all I could know in general about it. At their Departure, she and the Children had taken each a small Provision for their Flight, which hung about their Necks in a sort of Purse. 
I can't say, notwithstanding this Journey was taken with my Concurrence and Consent, that I was perfectly easy when they were gone; for my Affection for them all would work up imaginary Fears, too potent for my Reason to dispel, and which at first sat with no easy Pressure upon my Mind. This, my pretty Babies at home perceiving, used all the little winning Arts they could to divert and keep up my Spirits; and from Day to Day, by taking them abroad with me, and playing with, and amusing them at home, I grew more and more perswaded that all would go right with the Absent, and that in due Time I should see them return again. 
But as the Winter set in, I went little abroad, and then we employed ourselves within Doors, in preparing several Things, which might not only be useful and ornamental, if the old Glumm should come to see us, but might also divert us, and make the Time pass less tediously. The first Thing I went upon was a Table; which, as my Family consisted of so many, I intended to make big enough for us all. With that View I broke up a Couple of Chests, and taking the two Sides of one of them, I nailed them Edge to Edge, by strong thick Pieces underneath, at 
[Page 243]
each End, and in the Middle; then I took two Chest-lids with their Hinges, nailing one to each Side of my middle Piece, which made two good Flaps; after this, with my Tools, of which I had now a Chest full, I chopped out of new Stuff and planed four strong Legs quite square, and nailed them strongly to each Corner of my middle Board; I then nailed Pieces from one Leg to the other, and nailed the Bed likewise to them; then I fastened a Border quite round, within six Inches from the Bottom, from Foot to Foot, which held all fast together. When all this was done, still my Table was imperfect, I could not put up the Flaps, having no proper Support. To remedy this, I sawed out a broad Slip from a Chest Side, and boring a large Hole through the Centre, I spiked it up to the under-side of the Table's Bed, with a Spindle I contrived, just loose enough to play round the Head of the Spike, filing down that Part of the Spindle which passed through the Bed of the Table, and rivetting it close; so that when my Flaps were set up, I pulled the Slip cross-ways of the Table, and when the Flaps were down, the Slip turned under the Top of the Table, lengthways; next under each Flap, I nailed a small Slip, the lengthways of the Flaps, to raise them on a Level (when up) with the Top of the Table. When I had thus compleated the several Parts of this needful Utensil, I spent some Time and 
[Page 244]
Pains, by scraping and rubbing, to render it all as elegant as could be; and the Success so well answered my Wish, that I was not a little proud of the Performance: And what rendered my Work thereon a still more agreeable Task, was, my pretty Infants Company, who stood by, expressing their Wonder and Approbation at every Stroke. 
Now I had gotten a Table, I wanted Chairs to it; for as yet we had only sat round the Room upon Chests, which formed a Bench of the whole Circumference, they stood so thick. There was no moving of them without a monstrous Trouble, every Time I might have Occasion to set out my Table; besides, if I could have dragged them backwards and forwards, they were too low to be commodious for Seats; so I resolved to make some Chairs, and Stools also, that might be manageable. I will not trouble you with the Steps I took in the Formation of these; only, in general, you must know, that some more Chests I broke up to that Purpose served me for Timber, out of which I framed six sizeable handsome Chairs, and a competent Number of Stools. 
But now that I was turned Joiner I had another Convenience to provide for. I had nothing wherein to inclose Things, and preserve 'em from Dust, except the Chests; and they were quite unfit for holding Liquors, Victuals, and 
[Page 245]
such like Matters, in open Shells, as most of my Vessels were. Wherefore, having several Boards now remaining, of the Boxes I had broken up for Chairs and Stools, I bethought me of supplying this great Deficiency; so, of these spare Boards, in a Workman-like Way, (for by this Time I was become a tolerable Mechanic) I composed a very tight Closet, holding half a Dozen broad Shelves, shut up by a good Pair of Doors, with a Lock and Key to fasten 'em. 
These Jobs took me up almost three Months, and I thought I had not employed them idly, but for the Credit and Service of my Family. I was now again at Leisure for farther Projects. I was uncertain as to my Wife's Return, how soon she might be with me, or how much longer she might stay; but I was sure I could do nothing in the mean while more grateful, than encreasing, by all means in my Power, the Accommodations of my House, for the more polite as well as convenient Reception of her Father, or any else who might accompany her home, in the Way of a Retinue, as she talked of. I saw plainly I had not Room for lodging of them, and that was a Circumstance of main Importance to be provided for. Hereupon I thought of adding a long Apartment to one of my outer Rooms, to range against the Side of the Rock; but reflecting, that such a Thing would be quite useless, unless I could finish it in Time, so as to be 
[Page 246]
compleat when my Guests came and not knowing how soon that might be, I resolved to quit this Design; and I fell upon another, which might do as well, and required much less Labour, and fewer Days, to perfect. 
I remembred that amongst those Things my Wife had packed up on board the Ship, and which came home through the Gulph, there were two of the largest Sails, and a Couple of smaller Size. These I carried to the Wood, and tried them in several Places, to see where they might be disposed to most Advantage, in the Nature of a Tent; and having found a convenient Spot to my Purpose, I cut divers Poles for Supporters, and making Straining-lines of my Mat-weed, I pitched a noble one, sufficient to cover or entertain a numerous company, and so tight every where as to keep out the Weather. The front of this new appartment I hung with blue cloth; which had a very genteel Effect: I had almost forgotten to tell you, that I contrived so, (by hanging one of the smaller sails across, just in the Middle, which I could let down, or raise up at Pleasure) as to divide the Tent, occasionally, into two distinct Rooms. 
When I had proceeded thus far, there were still wanting Seats for this additional Building, as I may call it; and though I could spare some Chests to sit on, I found they would not half do. For a Supplement then I took my Ax, and felled 
[Page 247]
a Couple of great Trees, one from each Side of the Tent, sawed off the Tops, and cut each of the Trunks in two, about the Middle; these huge Cylinders I rolled into the Tent with a good deal of Toil and Difficulty; two of them I thrust into the inner Division, and left two in the outer; I placed them as Benches on both Sides; then with infinite Pains I shaved the upper Face of each smooth and flat, and pared off all the little Knots and Roughnesses of the Front, so that they were fitted to sit on; and their own Weight fixed them in the Place where I intended them to be. At the upper End of the further Chamber I set three Chests lengthwise, for Seats, or any other Use I might see sit to put them to. 
During these Operations we were all hard at it, and no Hand idle, but Dicky in Arms, and Sally, whom he kept in full Employ; but Pedro, being a sturdy Lad, could drive a Nail, and lift or carry the Things I wanted; and Jemmy and David, tho' so young, could pick up the Chips, hold a Nail, or the Lamp, or be some way or other useful: For I always preached to them the Necessity of earning their Bread before they eat it, and not think to live on mine and their Brother's Labour. 
The Nights being pretty long, after Work was over, and Sarah had fed her Brother, and laid him in his Hammock, we used to sit all 
[Page 248]
down to enjoy ourselves at a good Meal; for we were never regular at that till Night; and then after Meal, my Wife being absent, one or other of the young ones would begin with something they had before heard me speak of, by saying, Daddy, how did you use to do this or that in England; then all Ears were immediately open to catch my Answer, which certainly brought on something else, done either there or elsewhere; and by their little Questions and my Answers they would sometimes draw me into a Story of three Hours long, till perhaps two out of three of my Audience were falling asleep, and then we all went to Bed. 
I verily believe my Children would, almost any of them, from the frequent Repetition of these Stories, have given a sufficient Account of England, to have gained a Belief from almost any Englishman of their being Natives there. 
I frequently observed, that when we had begun upon Cornwall, and traversed the Mines, the Sea-Coast, or talked of the fine Gentlemen's Seats, and such Things, one would start up, and, if the Discourse flagged ever so little, would cry, ay but Daddy, what did you do when the Crocodile came after you out of the Water; and another, before that Subject was half ended, (and I was forced to enter on every one they started) would be impatient for the Story of the Lion; and I always took notice, that 
[Page 249]
the Part each had made the most Reflections on was always most acceptable to the same Person: But poor Sally would never let the Conversation drop without some Account of the Muletto, it was such a pretty gentle Creature she said. 
CHAP. XXVI. 

The Author's Concern at Youwarkee's Stay; Reflections on his Condition; hears a Voice call him; Youwarkee's Brother Quangrollart visits him with a Companion; he treats them at the Grotto; the Brother discovers himself by Accident; Wilkins produces his Children to him. 
My Head, as well as my Hands, had now been employed for five Months, in adjusting all Things in the most suitable Manner for the Reception of Youwarkee and her Friend; but nobody coming, and light Days getting forward apace, I began to grow very uneasy, and had formed divers Imaginations of what might occasion her Stay. Thought I, I am afraid all the Pains I have been taking will be to no Purpose; for either her Father will not let her return, or she has of herself come to such a Resolution. For she knows I cannot follow her, and had rather perhaps live, and enjoy the three Children she has with her, amidst a Number of her Friends and Acquaintance, than spend the Remainder of her Days with me and all our Offspring in this 
[Page 250]
Solitude. -But then I reflected, she chose it herself, or at least declared herself perfectly satisfied, yea delighted, therewith; and here are her Children with me, the major Part of them. - Yet, what can I think; since her Return is put off till the Swangeans are over at this Arkoe, she will never bring her Relations now, in this unseasonable Time for Flight: Therefore I must think, if she intended to return at all, it would have been before now; and as the Case is not so, my Fear of losing her intirely prevails greatly. O! says I, that we had but a Post here, as we have in England; there we can communicate our Thoughts at a Distance to each other, without any Trouble, and for little Charge! What a Country is this to live in, and what an improper Creature am I to live in it! Had I but the Graundee, I would have found her out by this Time, be she where she would; but, whilst every one about me can pass, repass, and act as they please, I am fixed here like one of my Trees, bound to the Spot, or upon Removal to die in the Attempt. Alas! why did I beget Children here, but to make them as wretched and inconsolable as myself. Some of them are so formed, indeed, as to shift for themselves; but they owe it to their Mother, not to me. What! am I a Father, of Children who will be bound one Day to curse me! Severe Reflection! yet I never thought of this till now. 
[Page 251]
But, am I the only Father in such a Case? No surely: For am not I as much bound to curse my Father, as my Children are to curse me? He might have left me happy if he would, I would them if I could. Again, are there not others, who, by improper Junction with Persons diseased in Body, or vicious in Mind, have intailed greater Misery upon their Posterity, than I have on mine? My Children are all healthy, strong, and sound, both in Body and Mind; and is not that the greatest Blessing that can be bestowed on our Beings? But they are imprisoned in this Arkoe. What then? with Industry here is no Want; and as they increase, they may settle in Communities, and be helpful to each other. I have lived well here, nigh sixteen Years, and it was God's Pleasure I should be here; and can I think I was placed here, with an Injunction contrary to the great Command, Increase and multiply? If that were so, can it be possible I should have received the only Means of propagating, as it were from Heaven itself? No, it was certainly as much my Maker's Will, that I should have Posterity here, as that I myself should at first be brought hither. This is a large and plentiful Spot, and capable of great Improvement, when there shall be Hands sufficient. How many petty States are less than these my Dominions? I have here a Compass of near 
[Page 252]
twenty Miles round, and how many Thousands grow voluntarily grey in a far less Circuit. 
I had hardly finished my Reflections (for I was sitting by myself in my Tent upon one of the Trees I had turned into Benches) when I heard a musical Voice call Peter, Peter. I started; what's this, says I; it is not Youwarkee's Voice; what can this mean? Listening, I heard it again; but at so great a Distance, I could but just perceive the Sound. Be it where it will, says I, I'll face it. Thus speaking, I went out of the Tent, and hearkned very attentively, but could hear nothing. I then run for my Gun, and walked through the Wood as fast as I could to the Plain; but still I neither saw or heard any thing. I was then in hopes of seeing somebody on the Lake, but no one appeared: for I was fully determined to make myself known to whomsoever I should meet, and, if possible, to gain some Intelligence of my Wife. But after so much fruitless Pains, my Hopes being at an End, I was returning, when I heard Peter, Peter, again, at a great Distance; the Sound coming from a different Quarter than at first. Upon this I stopped, and heard it repeated, and it was as if the Speaker approached nearer and nearer. Hereupon I stepped out of the Wood, (for I had just re-entered it upon my Return home) when I saw two Persons upon the Swangean, just over my Head. I cried 
[Page 253]
out, Who's that; and they immediately called again, Peter, Peter. Ors clam gee, says I, that is, here am I. On this they directly took a small Sweep round, (for they had overshot me before they heard me) and alighted just by me: When I perceived them to be my Wife's Countrymen, being dressed like her, with only broader Chaplets about their Heads, as she had told me the Glumms all wore. After a short Obeisance, they asked me if I was the Glumm Peter, * 27 Barkett to Youwarkee? I answered, I was. They then told me they came with a Message from Pendlehamby, † 28 Colamb of Arndrumnstake, my ‡ 29 Goppo, and from Youwarkee his Daughter. I was vastly rejoiced to see them, and to hear only the Name of my Wife. But though I longed to know their Message, I trembled to think of their mentioning it, as one of them was just going to do, for fear of hearing some things very displeasing: So I begged them to go through the Wood with me to the Grotto, where we should have more Leisure and Convenience for Talk, and where, at the same time, they might take some Refreshment. But though I had thus put off their Message, I could not forbear enquiring by the way, after the Health of my Goppo, and my Wife and Children, how they got to Arndrumnstake, and how they found their Relations and Friends. They told me all were well; 
[Page 254]
and that Youwarkee, as she did on me, desired I would think on her with true Affection. I found this was the Phrase of the Country. As for the rest, I hoped it would turn out well at last, tho' I dreaded to hear it. 
Being arrived at the Grotto, I desired my Guests to sit down, and take such Refreshment as I could prepare them. When they were seated, I went to work in order to provide 'em a Repast. Seeing my Fire piled up very high, and burning fierce, and the Children about it, they wondered where they were got, and who they had come to, and turned their Faces from it; but I setting some Chairs, so that the Light might not strike on their Eyes, they liked the Warmth well enough: Tho', I remarked, the Light did not affect them so much as it had done Youwarkee. 
Whilst I was cooking, the poor Children got all up in a Corner, and stared at the Strangers, not being able to conceive where they came from; and by Degrees crept all backwards into the Bedchamber, and hid themselves; for they had never before seen any body but my own Family. 
I observed that one of my Guests paid more than ordinary Respect to the other; and tho' their Graundees made no Distinction between them, yet there was something, I thought, much more noble in the Address and Behaviour 
[Page 255]
of the latter; and taking notice that he was also the chief Spokesman, I judged it proper to pay my Respects to him in a somewhat more distinguishing Manner; though, so as not to offend the other if I should happen to be mistaken. 
I first presented a Can of my Madeira, and took care, as if by Accident, to give it to Mr. Uppermost, as I thought him; who drank half of it, and would have given the Remainder to his Companion; but I begged him to drink it all up, and his Friend should be served with some presently: He did so, and thanked me by lifting his Hand to his Chin. I then gave the other a Can of the same Liquor, which he drank, and returned Thanks as his Companion had before. I then took a Can myself, and telling them I begged leave to use the Ceremony of my own Country to them, I drank, wishing their own Health, and that of all Relations at Arndrumnstake. He that I took for the Superior, fell a laughing heartily; ha, ha, ha, says he, this is the very Way my Sister does every Day at Arndrumnstake. Your Sister Sir, says I, pray has she ever been in Europe or in England. Well, says he, I have plainly discovered myself, which I did not intend to do yet; but truly Brother Peter, I mean none other than your own Wife, Youwarkee. 
The Moment I knew who he was, I rose up, and taking him by the Right-hand, lifted it to 
[Page 256]
my Lips, and kissed it. He likewise immediately stood up, and we embraced each other with great Tenderness. I then begged him, as I had so worthy and near a Relation of my Wife's with me, that he would not delay the Happiness I hoped for, in a Narrative from his Mouth, how it fared with my Father, Wife, and Children, and all their Kinsfolks and Friends, whom I had so often heard mentioned by my dearest Youwarkee, and so earnestly desired to see. 
My Brother Quangrollart (for that he told me was his Name) was preparing to gratify my Impatience; but seeing I had set the Entertainment on the Table, which consisted chiefly of Bread, several Sorts of Pickles and Preserves, with some cold salted Fish; he said, that eating would but interrupt the Thread of his Discourse, and therefore, with my Leave, he would defer the relating of what I desired for a little while; which we all thinking most proper, I desired him and his Friend (who might be another Brother for ought I knew) to refresh themselves with the poor Modicum I was able to provide them. 
Whilst my Brother Quangrollart was looking upon and handling his Plate, being what he had never before seen, his Friend had got the Handle of one of the Knives in his Mouth, biting it with all his Force; but finding he could 
[Page 257]
make nothing of that End, he tried the other, and got to champing the Blade. Perceiving what he was at, though I could not help laughing, I rose, and begging Pardon, took the Knife from him; telling him, I believed he was not acquainted with the Use of that Instrument, which was one of my Country Implements; and that the Design of it, which was called a Knife, and of that other, pointing to it, called a Fork, were, the one to reduce the Food into Pieces proper for chewing, and the other to convey it to the Mouth without daubing the Fingers, which must happen in handling the Food itself. And I then shewed him what Use I put them to, by helping each of them therewith to somewhat, and by cutting a Piece for myself, and putting it to my Mouth with the Fork. 
They both smiled, and looked very well pleased; and then I told 'em that the Plate was the only Thing that need be daubed, and when that was taken away, the Table remained clean. So, after I had helped each of them for the first Time, I desired them to help themselves where they liked best: And, to say the Truth, they did so, more dextrously than I could have expected. 
During our Repast, we had frequent Sketches of the Observations they made in their Flight, and of the Places where they had rested; and I could plainly see, that neither of them had ever 
[Page 258]
been at this Arkoe before, by hinting, that if they had not taken such a Course, they had missed me. 
I took particular notice which Part of my Entertainment they eat most of, that I might bring a fresh Supply of that when wanted; and I found, that tho' they eat heartily of my Bread and Preserves, and tasted almost of every thing else, they never once touched the Fish; which put me upon desiring I might help them to some. At this they looked upon each other, which I readily knew the Meaning of, and excused themselves, expressing great Satisfaction in what they had already gotten. I took however a Piece of Fish on my own Plate, and eating very heartily thereof, my Brother desired me to give him a Bit of it; I did so, taking care to cut it as free from Bones as I could, and for greater Security cautioning him, in case there should be any, to pick them out, and not swallow them. He had no sooner put a Piece in his Mouth, but, Rosig, says he to his Friend, this is Padsi. I thought indeed I had puzzled my Brother when I gave him the Fish, but by what he said of it he puzzled me; for I knew not what he meant by Padsi, my Wife having told me they had no Fish: or, else, I should have taken that Word for their Name of it. However, I cut Rosig a Slice; and he agreeing it was Padsi, they both eat heartily of it. 

[Page 259]
While we were at Dinner, my Brother told me he thought he saw some of my Children just now; for his Sister had informed him she had five more at home; and he asked me why they did not appear, and eat with us. I excused their Coming, as fearing they would only be troublesome; and said, when we had done they should have some Victuals. But he would not be put of, and entreated me to admit 'em. So I called them by their Names, and they came, all but Dicky, who was asleep in his Hammock. I told them, that * 30 Reglumni, pointing to Quangrollart, was their Uncle, their Mamma's Brother, and ordered them to pay their Obeisance to him, which they severally did. I then made them salute Rosig. This last would have had them sit down at Table; but I positively forbid that; and giving each of them a little of what we had before us, they carried it to the Chests and eat it there. 
When we had done, the Children helped me to clear the Table, and were retiring out of the Room; but then I recalled them, and desired their Uncle to excuse their Stay: For as he had promised me News of their Mammy and her Family, it would be the Height of Pleasure to them to hear him. He seemed very much pleased with this Motion, desiring by all Means they 
[Page 260]
might be present while he told his Story. Whereupon I ordered them to the Chests again, while Quangrollart delivered his Narrative. 
CHAP. XXVII. 

Quangrollart's Account of Youwarkee's Journey, and Reception at her Father's. 
Having set on the Table some Brandy and Madeira, and each of us taken one Glass of both, I shewed by the Attentiveness of my Aspect and Posture how desirous I was he should proceed to what he had promised. Observing this, he went on in the following Manner. Brother Peter, says he, my Sister Youwarkee, as I don't doubt you will be glad to hear of her first, arrived very safe at Arndrumnstake, the third Day after she left you, and after a very severe Flight to the dear little * 31 Hallycarnie, who was a full Day and a Night on her Graundee; and at last would not have been able to have reached Battingdrigg but for my Sister's Assistance, who, taking her sometimes on her Back for a short Flight, by those little Refreshments 
[Page 261]
enabled her to perform it; but from Battingdrigg, after some Hours Rest, they came with Pleasure to the White Mountains, from whence, after a small Stay, they arrived at Arndrumnstake. 
They alighted at our * 32 Covett, but were opposed at their Entrance by the Guards, to whom they did not chuse to discover themselves, till Notice was given to my Father; who, upon hearing that some Strangers desired Admittance to him, sent me to introduce them, if they were proper for his Presence, or else give Orders for such other Reception as was suitable to them. 
When I came to the Guard, I found three Gawreys and a † 33 Glumm Boss, whose Appearance and Behaviour, I must own, prejudiced me very much in their Favour. I then asked from whence they came, and their Business with the Colamb? Youwarkee told me they came not about Business of publick Concern, relating to the Colamb's Office, but out of a dutiful Regard, as Relations, to kiss his Knees. My Father, said I, shall know it immediately; but first, pray inform me of your Name? Your Father, replied Youwarkee, are you my Brother Quangrollart? My Name is so, says I, but I have only one Sister, now with my Father, and how I can be your Brother, I am not able to guess. Have you never had another Sister, says she? 
[Page 262]
Yes, says I, but she is long since dead; her Name was Youwarkee. At my mentioning her Name, she fell upon my Neck in Tears, crying, my dear Brother, I am that dead Sister Youwarkee, and these with me are some of my Children, for I have five more; but pray how does my Father and Sister? I started back at this Declaration, to view her and the Children, fearing it was some gross Imposition; not in the least knowing or remembring any thing of her Face, after so long an Absence; but I desired them to walk in, 'till I told my Father. 
The Guard, observing the several Passages between us, were amazed to think who it could be had so familiarly embraced me; especially as they plainly saw I only played a passive Part in it. 
When I went in, I did not think proper directly to inform my Father what had happened; but calling my Sister Hallycarnie, I let her into the Circumstances of this odd Affair, and desired her Advice what to do: For, says I, surely this must be some Imposture; and as my Father has scarce yet subdued his Sorrow for my Sister's Loss, if this Gawry should prove a Deceiver, it will only revive his Affliction, and may prove, at this Time, extreamly dangerous to him: Therefore let's consider, what had best be done in the Matter. 

[Page 263]
Hallycarnie, who had attentively weighed all I said, seemed to think it was some Cheat, as well as I did; for we could neither of us conceive, that any thing but Death, or being slit, could have kept Youwarkee so long from the Knowledge of her Relations; and, that neither of them could be the Case, was plain, if the Person attending was Youwarkee. Besides, Brother, says Hallycarnie, she cannot surely be so much altered in fifteen Years, but you must have known her: And yet, now I think, it is possible, you being so much younger, may have forgot her; but whilst we have been talking of her, I have so well recollected her, that I think I could hardly be imposed upon by any Deceiver. 
I then desired her to go with me to the Strangers, and see if she could make any Discovery. She did so, and had no sooner enter'd the * 34 Abb, but Youwarkee called out, my dear Sister Hallycarnie; and she as readily recollecting Youwarkee, they in Transport embraced each other; and then your Wife presenting to us her three Children, it proved the tenderest Scene, except the following, I ever saw. 
My Father having kept his Chamber some Time with a Fever, and, though he was pretty well recovered, having not yet been out of it; we consulted how we might introduce our Sister 
[Page 264]
and her Children to him, with as little Surprize as might be, for Fear of a Relapse, by too great a Hurry of his Spirits. At length we concluded, I should go tell him, that some Strangers had arrived, desiring to see him; but, on Inquiry, finding their Business was too trifling to trouble him upon, I had dispatched them: I was then to say, how like one of them was to my Sister Youwarkee; and, whilst I was speaking, Hallycarnie was to enter, and keep up the Discourse, till we should find a proper Opportunity of Discovery. I went in therefore, as had been agreed; and, upon mentioning the Name of Youwarkee, my Father fetched a deep Sigh, and turned away from me in Tears. At that Instant Hallycarnie came in as by Accident; Sir, says she, what makes you so sad, are you worse to-day! O! says he, I have heard a Name that will never be out of my Heart, till I am in * 35 Hoximo. What, I suppose my Sister? 'Tis true, replied he, the same. Says she, I fancied so; for I have just seen a Stranger as like her as two † 36 Dorrs could be, and would have sworn it was she, if that had been possible. I thought my Brother had been so imprudent as to mention her to you; and I think he did not do well to rip up an old Sore he knew was almost healed, and make it break out afresh. Ah! no, 
[Page 265]
Child, says my Father, that Sore never has, or can be healed. O great Image! why can't I by some Means or other be ascertained what End she came to. 
Sir, says my Sister, I think you are much to blame for these Exclamations, after so long Absence: For, if she be dead, what Use are they of, and if she be not, all may be well, and you may still see her again. O never, never, says my Father; but could I be sure she was alive, I would take a Swangean, and never close my Graundee, till I found her, or dropt dead in the Search. And suppose you could meet with her, Sir, says I, the very Sight would overcome you, and be dangerous. No, believe me, Boy, says he, I should then be fully easy and composed; and were she to come in this Moment, I should suffer no Surprize, but Pleasure. No Surprize, Sir, says I? Not if she were alive and well, says he. Then Sir, says Hallycarnie, will you excuse me if I introduce her; and went out directly, without staying for an Answer. 
When she was gone, Quangrollart, says my Father sternly, what is the Meaning of your's and your Sister's playing thus upon my Weakness? It is what I can upon no Account forgive. It looks as if you were weary of me, and wanted to break my Heart. To what Purpose is all this Prelude of yours, to introduce to me somebody, who, by her Likeness to my Daughter, 
[Page 266]
may expose me to your Scoff and Raillery? This is a Disobedience I never expected from either of you. 
The great Image attend me! says I, Sir, you have much mistaken me; but I will not leave you in Doubt, even till Hallycarnie's Return; you shall see Youwarkee with her; for all our Discourse, I'll assure you, has but been concerted to prepare you for her Reception, with three of her Children. And am I then (says he in a Transport) still to be blessed? You are Sir, says I; assure yourself you are. 
By this Time we heard them coming; but my poor Father had not Power to go to meet them: And upon Youwarkee's nearer Approach, to fall at his Knees, his Limbs failing him, he sunk, and, without speaking a Word, fell backwards on a * 37 Cught Drappec, which stood behind him; and being quite motionless, we concluded him to be stone dead. On this, the Women became intirely helpless, screaming only, and wringing their Hands in extravagant Postures. But I, having a little more Presence of Mind, called for the ‡ 38 Calentar, who, by holding his Nose, pinching his Feet, and other Applications, in a little Time brought him to his Senses again. 

[Page 267]
You may more easily conceive than I describe, both the Confusion we were all in, during my Father's Disorder, and the Gratulations upon his Recovery: So, as I can give you but a defective Account of these, I shall pass 'em by, and come to our more serious Discourse, after my Father and your Wife had, without speaking a Word, wept themselves quite dry on each other's Necks. 
My Father then looking upon the three Children, (who were also crying to see their Mammy cry) and who are these, says he? These Sir, says Youwarkee, are three (of eight) of your Grand-children. And where is your Barkatt, says he? At home with the rest Sir, replied she, who are some of them too small to come so far yet: But Sir, says she, pray excuse my answering you any more Questions, till you are a little recovered from the Commotion I perceive my Presence has brought upon your Spirits; and as Rest, the Calentar says, will be exceedingly proper, I will retire with my Sister till you are better able to bear Company. My Father was with much Difficulty prevailed with to part with her out of his Sight; but the Calentar pressing it, we were all dismissed, and he lay down to Rest. 
My Brother would have gone on, but I told him, as it grew near Time for Repose, and he 
[Page 268]
and Rosig must needs be fatigued with so long a Flight, if they pleased (as I had already heard the most valuable Part of all he could say, in that my Father received my Wife and Children so kindly, and that he left them all well) we would defer his farther Relation till the next Day: Which they both agreeing to, I laid them in my own Bed, myself sleeping in a spare Hammock. 
CHAP. XXVIII. 

A Discourse on Light; Quangrollart explains the Word Crashee; believes a Fowl is a Fruit; gives a further Account of Youwarkee's Reception by her Father, and by the King; Tommy and Hallycarnie provided for at Court; Youwarkee and her Father visit the Colambs, and are visited; her Return put off till next Winter, when her Father is to come with her. 
The next Day I prepared again of the best of every thing for my new Guests. I killed three Fowls, and ordered Pedro, (who was as good a Cook almost as myself) to get them ready for boiling, whilst we took a Walk to the Lake. Tho' we went out in the clearest Part of the Morning, I heard no Complaint of the Light. I took the Liberty to ask my Brother, 
[Page 269]
if the Light did not offend him; for I told him my Wife could not bear so much without Spectacles. What is that Spectacle, says he? Something I made your Sister, says I, to prevent the Inconvenience of too much Light upon her Eyes. He said the Light was scarce at all troublesome to him, for he had been in much greater, and was used to it; and that the Glumms, who travelled much abroad, could bear more Light than the Gawrys, who staid much at home: these stirring but little out, unless in large Companies, and that of one another, and very rarely admitting Glumms amongst them before Marriage. For his own Part, he said, he had an Office at * 39 Crash Doorpt, which, though he executed chiefly by a Deputy, obliged him to reside there sometimes for a long Season together; and that being a more luminous Country than Arndrumnstake, Light was become familiar to him; for it was very observable, that some who had been used to it young, though they might in Time overcome it, yet at first it was very uneasy. 
I was upon the Tenter whilst he spoke, lest, before he had done, a Question, I had a thousand Times thought to have asked my Wife, should slip out of my Head, as it had so often done before: and was, what I had for Years desired 
[Page 270]
to be resolved in, viz. What the Meaning of the Word Slitt was, when applied to a Man? So, on his pausing, I said, that his Mention of Crash-doorpt reminded me of inquiring what Crashee meant, when applied to a Glumm, or Gawry. It would be no hard Task, he said, to satisfy me in respect of that, as I already understood the Nature of the Graundee; whereupon he went on thus: "" But what is still worse to new Comers, if they are not very young, is, the Light of the Place, which is so strong, that it is some Years before they can overcome it, if ever they do. 
This Discourse gave me a great Pleasure; thereupon I repeated the Dialogue that had pass'd between me and Youwarkee about my being slit, and how we had held an Argument a long Time, without being able to come at one another's Meaning. But pray Brother, says I, how comes that light Country to agree so well with you? Why, says he, the ‡ 42 Colambat of Crash-Doorpt is reckoned one of the most honourable Employments in the State, by reason of the Hazard of it, and the Person accepting it must be young; it was, by my Father's Interest at Court, given to me at nine Years of Age; my Friend Rosig has followed my Fortune in it ever since, being much about my Age, and has a Post under me there: In short, by being obliged to be so much there, and from so tender an Age too, I have pretty well enured myself to any Light. 

[Page 272]
By this Time we had got home again to Dinner, which Pedro had set out as elegantly as my Country could afford, consisting of Pickles and Preserves, as usual, a Dish of hard Eggs, and boiled Fowls with Spinage. 
My Guests, as I expected, stared at the Fowls, but never offered to touch them, or seemed in the least inclinable to do so. I was afraid they would be cold, and begged them to let me help them. I put a Wing on each of their Plates, and a Leg on my own; but perceiving they waited to see how I managed it, I stuck in my Fork, cut off a Slice, dipped it in the Salt, and put it in my Mouth. Just as I did they did, and appeared very well pleased with the Taste. I never in my Life, says Rosig, saw a * 43 Crullmott of this Shape before; and laid hold of a Leg, (taking it for a Stick I had thrust in, as he told me afterwards) intending to pull it out; but finding it grew there, Mr. Peter, says he, you have the oddest shaped Crullmotts that ever I saw, pray what Part of the Woods do they grow in? Grow in, says I? Ay, says he, I mean whether your Crullmott-Trees are like ours or not? Why, says I, these Fowls are about my Yard and the Wood too. What, says he, is it a running Plant like a † 44 Bott. No, no, says I, a Bird that I keep tame about my House; and these, (shewing 
[Page 273]
him the Eggs) are the Eggs of these Birds, and the Birds grow from them. Prithee, says Quangrollart, never let's inquire what they are till we have dined; for my Brother Peter will give us nothing we need be afraid of. 
It growing into the Night, by that Time we rose from Table, I set a Bowl of Punch before them, made with my Treacle and sour Rams-horn Juice, which they pulled off plentifully. After some Bumpers had gone round, I desired my Brother to proceed where he left off, in the Account of my Wife's Reception with her Father. 
When my Father, says he, had recovered himself by some Hours Repose, the first Thing he did was to order my Sister Youwarkee to be called; who coming into his Presence, he took her from her Knees, kissed her, and ordered all to depart but myself and Hallycarnie. Then bidding us sit down, says he to your Wife, Daughter, your Appearance, whom I have so long lamented as dead, has given me the truest Cordial I could have received, and I hope will add both to my Health and Years. I have heard, you suspect my Anger for some Part of your past Conduct (for she had hinted so to her Sister and me) which you justly enough imagine may be censured; but, my dear Life, I am this Day (what I did not expect any more to be) a Father of a new-born Child; and not of one only, but of many; and this Day, I say, Daughter, shalt 
[Page 274]
not be spent in Sorrow and Excuses, or any thing to interrupt our mutual Felicity; neither will I ever hereafter permit you to beg my Forgiveness, or attempt to palliate any of your Proceedings; for know, Child, that a Benevolence freely bestowed, is better than twice its Value obtained by Petition: I therefore, as in Presence of the great Image, your Brother and Sister, at this Instant, erase from my Mind for-ever what Thoughts I may have had prejudicial to the Love I ever bore you, as I will have you to do all such as may cloud the unreserved Complacency you used to appear with before me: And now Quangrollart, says he, let the Guard be drawn out before my Covvett, and let the whole Country be entertained, for seven Days; proclaim Liberty to all Persons confined; and let not the least Sorrow appear in any Face throughout my Colambat. 
I retired immediately, and gave the necessary Orders for the speedy Dispatch of my Father's Commands; which indeed were performed to the utmost; and nothing for seven Days was to be heard, through the whole District of Arndrumnstake, but Joy and the Name of Youwarkee. 
My Father, so soon as he had dispatched the above Orders, sent for the Children before him, whom he kissed and blessed, frequently lifting up his Eyes in Gratitude to the Great Image, for 
[Page 275]
the unexpected Happiness he enjoyed on that Occasion; and then he ordered Youwarkee to let him know what had befallen her in her Absence, and where she lived, and with whom. 
Youwarkee was setting out with some indirect Excuses; but my Father absolutely forbid her, and charged her only to mention plain Facts, without Flourishes. So she began with her Swangean, and the accidental Fall she had, your taking her in after it, and saving her Life. She told him, your continued Kindness so wrought upon her, that she found herself uncapable of disesteeming you, but never shewed her Affection, till, having examined every Particular of your Life, and finding you a worthy Man, she could not avoid becoming your Wife; and she said, the Reason why she always declined being seen by her Friends, in their Swangeans, was, for Fear she should be forced from you, tho' she longed to see us; and that at last, she was come by your Consent; and, that had it rested there only, she might have come much sooner; for that you would often have had her shew herself to her Friends, when you heard them, having strong Desires yourself to be known to them. 
My Father upon hearing this, was so charmed with your Tenderness and Affection to his Daughter, that you already rival his own Issue in his Esteem, and he is perswaded he can never do enough for you or your Children. 

[Page 276]
The Noise of Youwarkee's Return, and my Father's Rejoicing, soon spread over all Normnbdsgrsutt; and King Georigetti sent Express to my Father, to command him to attend with your Wife and Children at Brandleguarp, his Capital. Thither accordingly we all went, with a grand Retinue, and staid twenty Days. The King took great Delight, as well as the Ladies of the Court, to hear Youwarkee and her Children talk English, and in being informed of you and your Way of Life; and, so fond was Yurcumbourse (who, though not the King's Wife, is instead of one) of my Nephew Tommy, that, upon my Father's Return, she took him to herself, and assured my Sister, he should continue near her Person till he was qualified for better Preferment. The King's Sister Jahamel, would also have taken Patty into her Service; but she begged to be permitted to attend her Mother to Arndrumnstake; so Hallycarnie her Sister, who chose to continue with Jahamel, was received in her Room. 
Upon my Father's Return to Arndrumnstake, he sound no less than fifteen Expresses from several Colambs, desiring to rejoice with him on the Return of his Daughter, with particular Invitations to him and her to spend some Time with them. My Father, though he hates more Pomp than is necessary to support Dignity, could do no less than severally visit them, with Youwarkee, 
[Page 277]
attended by a grand Retinue, spending more or less Days with each; hoping when that was over, he should have some little Time to spend in Retirement with his Daughter before her Departure, who now began to be uneasy for you, who, she said, would suffer the greatest Concern in her Absence; but, upon their Return from those Visits, at about the End of four Months Progress, they found themselves in as little Likelihood of Retirement as the first Day: For the inferior Colambs were continually posting away, one after another, to perform their Respects to my Father, and all the inferior Magistrates of smaller Districts sending to know when they might be permitted to do the same. Poor Youwarkee, who saw no End of it, expressed her Concern for you in so lively a Manner to my Father, that, finding he could by no Means put a Stop to the Good-will of the People, and not bearing the Thoughts of Youwarkee's Departure, till she had now received all their Compliments, he resolved to keep her with him till the next Winter set in in these Parts, and then to accompany her himself to Graundevolet. In the mean while, that you might not remain in an uneasy Suspence what was become of my Sister, he ordered me to dispatch Messengers express to inform you of the Reasons of her Stay: But I told him, if he pleased, I would execute that Office myself, with my Friend Rosig; with which he 
[Page 278]
was very well pleased, and enjoined me to assure you of his Affection, and that he himself was Debtor to you for the Love and Kindness you had shewn his Daughter. 
Thus Brother, says Quangrollart, I hope I have acquitted myself of my Charge to your Satisfaction; and it only now remains that I return you my Acknowledgments for your hearty Welcome to myself and Friend: Which (with Concern I speak it) I am afraid I shall not have an Opportunity to return at Arndrumnstake, the Distance being so immensely great, and you not having the Graundee. To-morrow Morning my Friend and I will set out on our Return home. 
Quangrollart having done, I told him I could not but blush at the Load of undeserved Praises he had laid on me; but, as he had received his Notion of my Merits from a Wife, too fond to let my Character sink for want of her Support, it would be sufficient if himself could conceive of, and also represent me at his Return, in no worse a Light than other Men; and though it gave me Pain to think of losing my Wife so long, yet his Account of her Health, and the Company he assured me she would return in, would doubly compensate my Loss; and I begged of him, if it might be, with any Convenience, he would let some Messenger come the Day before her, to give me notice of their Approach. As to their 
[Page 279]
Departure on the morrow, I told them I could by no Means think of that; as I had proposed to catch them a Dinner of fresh Fish in the Lake, and to shew them my Boat, and how and where I came into this Arkoe; believing, by what I had observed, it would be no small Novelty to them. So having engaged them one Day more, we parted for that Night to Rest. 
CHAP. XXIX. 

The Author Quangrollart shews Rosig his Poultry; they are surprized at them; he takes them a fishing; they wonder at his Cart, and at his shooting a Fowl; they are terribly frightened at the string of the Gun; Wilkins pacifies them. 
I was heartily sorry to lose my Brother thus quickly, and still more so, to find it would be a long Time yet 'ere I should see my Wife; however, I was resolved to behave as chearfully as possible, and to omit nothing I could do, the few remaining Hours of Quangrollart's Stay with me, to rivet myself thoroughly in his Esteem, and to dismiss him with a most cordial Affection to me and the rest of my Children here with him. I rose early in the Morning to provide a good Breakfast for my Guests, and considering we should be in the Air most Part of that Day, I treated them with a Dish of hot Fish Soup, and set 
[Page 280]
before them on the Table a jovial Bottle of Brandy, and my silver Can: This last Piece I chose to shew them, as a Specimen of the Richness of my Houshold Furniture, and the Grandeur of my living, concealing most of my other Curiosities, till Pendlehamby my Father-in-Law's Arrival; for I thought it would be imprudent not to have somewhat new of this Kind to display at his Entertainment. 
After a plenteous Meal, we set out on our pleasurable Expedition; having told Pedro what to get for Dinner, and that I believed we should not return till late. 
We first took a Turn in the Wood; but I did not lead them near my Tent, because I did not chuse my Wife should hear of that till she came. I then shewed them my Farm-yard and Poultry; which they were strangely surprized at, and wondered to see so many Creatures come at my Call, and run about my Legs, only upon a Whistle, tho' before there were only two or three to be seen. They asked me an hundred Questions about the Fowl, which I answered, and told them, these were some such as they had eaten, and called Crullmotts, the Day before. I afterwards carried them to hear the Music of those Plants that I call my Cream-cheese; which, as there happened to be a small Breeze stirring, made their usual Melody. 

[Page 281]
When we had diverted ourselves some time in the Wood, we went to the wet Dock, where I shewed them my Boat. At first View they wondered what Use it was for; to satisfy them in that I stepped in, desiring them to follow me; but seeing the Boat's Agitation, they did not chuse to venture, till I assured them they might come with the greatest Safety: At length, with some Persuasion, and repeated Assurances, I prevailed on them to trust themselves with me. 
We first rowed to the Bridge, where I informed them by what Accident I was drawn down the Stream, on the other Side of the Rock, and after a tedious and dangerous Passage, discharged safe in the Lake through that Opening. 
I then told them how surprized I had been, just before I knew Youwarkee, with the Sight of her Country Folks; first on the Lake, and then taking Flight from that Bridge; and what had been my Thoughts, and how great my Terrors on that Occasion. 
After we had viewed the Bridge, I took them to my Rill, (for by this time they were reconciled to the Boat, and would help me to row it) and shewed them how I got Water. I then landed them to see the Method of Fishing; for which Purpose I laid my Net in proper Order, and fixing it as usual, I brought it round out at the Rill, and had a very good Hawl, with which I 
[Page 282]
desired them to help me up; for though I could easily have done it myself, I had a Mind to let them have a Hand in the Sport, with which they were pleased. I perceived however, the Fish were not agreeable to them; for when any one came near their Hands, they avoided touching it. Notwithstanding, having got the Net on shore, I laid it open: But to see how they stared at the Fish, creeping backwards, and then at me and the Net, it made me very merry to myself, though I did not care to shew it. 
I drew up at that Draught twenty-two Fishes in all, of which a few were near an Ell long, several about two Feet, and some smaller. When they saw me take up the large ones in my Arms, and tumble them into the Boat, they both, unrequested, took up of the small ones, and put them in likewise; but dropping them every Time they struck their Tails, the Fish had commonly two or three Falls 'ere they came to the Boat. 
I asked them how they liked that Sport, and they told me it was something very surprizing that I should know just where the Fish were, as they could see none before I pulled them up, and yet they did not hear me whistle. I perceived by this, they imagined I could whistle the Fish together as well as the Fowls, and I did not undeceive them; being well enough pleased they should think excellent for something, 
[Page 283]
as I really thought they were on account of the Graundee. 
Upon our Return, when I had docked my Boat, as there were too many Fish to carry up by Hand to the Grotto, I desired them to take a Turn upon the Shore till I fetched my Cart for it. I made what haste I could, and brought one of my Guns with me, which I determined upon some Occasion or other to fire off; for I took it they would be more surprised at the Explosion of that, than at any thing they had yet seen. Having loaded my Fish, and marched backwards, they eyed my Cart very much, and wondered what made the Wheels move about so; taking them for Legs it walked upon, till I explained the Reason of it, and then they desired to draw it, which they did with great Eagerness, one at a Time, the other observing its Motions. 
As we advanced homewards, there came a large Water-Fowl, about the Size of a Goose, flying cross us. I bid them look at it, which they did. Says my Brother, I wish I had it. If you have a mind for it, says I, I'll give it you. I wish you would, says he, for I never saw any thing like it in my Life. Stand still then, says I, and stepping two or three Yards before them, I fired, and down it dropt. I then turned about, to observe what Impression the Gun had made on them, and could not help laughing to see 
[Page 284]
them so terrified. Rosig, before I could well look about, had got fifty Paces from me, and my Brother was lying behind the Cart of Fish. I called and asked them what was the Matter, and desired them to come to me, telling them they should receive no Harm, and offered my Brother the Gun to handle; but he, thanking me as much as if he had, retired to Rosig. 
Finding they made a serious Affair of it, for I saw them whispering together, I was under some Apprehension for the Consequences of my Frolick. Thinks I, if under this Disgust they take Flight, refusing to hear me, and report that I was about to murder them, or tell any other pernicious Story to my Father of me, I am absolutely undone, and shall never see Youwarkee more. So I laid down the Gun by the Fish, and moving slowly towards them, expostulated with them upon their Disorder; assuring them, that though the Object before them might surprize them, it was but a common Instrument in my Country, which every Boy used to take Birds with; and protested to them, that the Gun of itself could do nothing without my Skill directing it; and that they might be sure I should never employ that, but to their Service. This, and a great deal more, brought us together again; and when we came to reasoning cooly, they blamed me for not giving them Notice. Says I, there was no Room for me to explain 
[Page 285]
the Operation of the Gun to you, whilst the Bird was on the Wing; for it would have been gone out of my Reach before I could have made you sensible of that, and so have escaped me; which, as you desired me to get it you, I was resolved it should not do. But for yourselves, surely you could have no Diffidence in me: That is highly unbecoming of Man to Man, especially Relations; and, above all, a Relation to whom you have brought the welcomest News upon Earth, in the Love of my dear Father, and his Reconciliation to my Wife. 
At last, by Degrees, I brought them to confess, that it was only a groundless sudden Terror which suppressed their Reason for a while; but that what I said was all very true; and as their serious Reflection returned, they were satisfied of it. I then stepped for the Bird, and brought it to them: It was a very fine feathered Creature, and they were very much delighted with the Beauty of it, and desired it might be laid upon the Cart, and carried home. 
All the Way we went afterwards to the Grotto, nothing was to be heard from them but my Praises, and what a great and wise Man Brother Peter was; and no Wonder now, Sister Youwarkee, (says Quangrollart) once knowing him, could never leave him. It was not my Business to gainsay this, but only to receive it with so much Modesty as might serve to heighten 
[Page 286]
their good Opinion of me; and I found, upon my Wife's Return, that Quangrollart had painted me in no mean Colours to his Father. 
I once more had the Pleasure of entertaining them, with the old Fare, and some of the fresh Fish, Part boiled and Part fryed; which last they chose before the boiled. We made a very chearful Supper, talking over that Day's Adventures, and of their ensuing Journey home; after which we retired to Rest, mutually pleased. We all arose early: the next Morning. We took a short Breakfast; after which Quangrollart and Rosig stuck their Chaplets with the longest and most beautiful Feathers of the Bird I shot, thinking them a fine Ornament. Being now ready for Departure, they embraced me and the Children, and were just taking Flight, when it came into my Head, that as the King's Mistress had taken Tommy into her Protection, it might possibly be a Means of ingratiating him in her Favour, if I sent him the Flagellet, (for I had), in my Wife's Absence, made two others near as good, by copying exactly after it.) I therefore desired to know, if one of them would trouble himself with a small Piece of Wood, I very much wanted to convey to my Son. Rosig answered, with all his Heart; if it was not very long he would put it into his Colapet * 45 . So I stepped in, 
[Page 287]
and fetching the Flagellet, presented it to Rosig. My Brother seeing it look oddly, with Holes in it, desired (after he had asked if it was not a little Gun) to have the handling of it. It was given him, and he surveyed it very attentively. Being inquisitive into the Use of it, I told him it was a musical Instrument, and played several Tunes upon it; with which he and his Companion were in Raptures. I doubt not, they would have sat a Week to hear me, if I would have gone on; but I desiring the latter to take care of its Safety, he put it in his Colapet, and away they went.

To the Right Honourable ELIZABETH, Countess of Northumberland. 
MADAM, 
Few Authors, I believe, who write in my Way, (whatever View they may set out with) can, in the Prosecution of their Work, forbear to dress their fictitious Characters, in the real Ornaments themselves have been most delighted with. 

[Page -]
This, I confess, hath been my Case, in the Person of Youwarkee, in the following Sheets; for having formed her Body, I found myself at an inexpressible Loss how to adorn her Mind in the masterly Sentiments I coveted to endue her with; 'till I recollected the most aimable Pattern in your Ladyship; a single View of which, at a Time of the utmost Fatigue to his Lordship, hath charmed my Imagination ever since. 
If a Participater of the Cares of Life in general, alleviates the Concerns of Man; what an invaluable Blessing must that Lady prove, to the Softness of whose Sex Nature hath conjoined an Aptitude for Council, an Application, Zeal and Dispatch, 
[Page -]
but too rarely found in his own? 
Had my Situation in Life been so happy as to have presented me with Opportunities of more frequent and minuter Remarks upon your Ladyship's Conduct, I might have defy'd the whole British Fair to have outshone my southern Gawry: For if, to a majestick Form and extensive Capacity, I had been qualified to have copied that natural Sweetness of Disposition, that maternal Tenderness, that Chearfulness, that Complacency, Condescension, Affability, and unaffected Benevolence, which so apparently distinguish the Countess of Northumberland; I had exhibited in my 
[Page -]
Youwarkee, a Standard for future Generations. 
Madam, I am the more sensible of my Speaking but the Truth, from the late Instance of your Benignity, which intitles me to the Honour of subscribing myself, 
Madam, 
Your Ladyship's 
most obliged and 
most obedient Servant 
R. P. 

[Page 1]
A GENUINE ACCOUNT OF THE LIFE OF PETER WILKINS.
CHAP. I. 

Peter prepares for his Father's Reception; Arguments about his Beard; expects his Wife; Reflections on her not coming; sees a Messenger on the Rock; has Notice of Pendlehamby's Arrival, and prepares a Treat. 
The News my late Visitors had brought me, set my Mind quite at ease; and now, having leisure to look into my own Affairs, with the Summer before me, I began to consider what Preparations I must make against the Return of my Wife; for according to the Report I had heard, I concluded there would be a great Number of Attendants; 
[Page 2]
and, as her Father would no doubt pique himself upon the Grandeur of his Equipage, if his Followers should see nothing in me, but a plain dirty Fellow, I should be contemned, and perhaps my Wife, thro' my means, be slighted; or, at least, lose that Respect the Report of me had in a great measure procured her. 
The first thing therefore that I did, was to look into my Chests again, wherein I knew there were many of the Portuguese Captain's Cloaths, and take out such as would be most suitable to the Occasion, and lay them all by themselves. I found a blue Cloth laced Coat double-breasted, with very large gold Buttons, and very broad gold Button-holes, lined with white Silk; a Pair of black Velvet Breeches, a large gold-laced Hat, and a Point Neckcloth, with two or three very good Shirts, two Pair of red-heeled Shoes, a Pair of white, and another of scarlet Silk Stockings, two silver-hilted Swords, and several other good things; but upon Examination of these Cloaths, and by a Letter or two found in the Pockets of some of them, directed to Captain Jeremiah Vauclaile, in Threadneedle-Street, London, I judged these belonged to the English Captain, taken by the Portuguese Ship in Africa. I immediately tried some of them on, and thought they became me very well, and laid all those in particular Chests, to be ready when the Time came, and set them into one of my inner Rooms. 

[Page 3]
Upon examining the Contents of another Chest, I found a long scarlet Cloak laced, a Case of Rasors, a Pair of Scissars, and Shaving-glass; a Long-wig, and two Bob-wigs, and laid them by; for I was determined, as I might possibly have no other Opportunity, to make myself appear as considerable as I could. 
When I had digested in my Mind upon what Occasions I would appear in either of them, and laid them in proper Order, Pedro, and I went several Days to work with the Net, and caught abundance of Fish, which I salted, and dried; and we cut a great Quantity of long Grass to dry, and spread in my Tent, for the lower Gentry, and made up a little Cock of it; we also cut, and piled up a large Parcel of Fire-wood; and as I had now about thirty of the best Fish-skins, each of which would cover four Chairs, I nailed them on for Cushions to my Chairs, and the rest I sewed together, and made Rugs of them. 
I had observed, that my Brother Quangrallort, and Rossig, neither of them had Beards, and as they were quite smooth chinned, I conjectured that none of their Countrymen had any; so, says I, if that is the case, as I have now both Scissars, and Rasors; I will e'en cut off mine, to be like them: I then set up my Glass, taking my Scissars in hand; but had not quite closed them for a Snip, when I considered, that as I was not of their Country, and was so different from them in other 
[Page 4]
respects, whether it would not add to my Dignity, to appear with my Beard before them: This I debated some time, and then determined in favour of my Beard; but as this Question still ran in my Mind, and I wavered sometimes this way, sometimes that; I some Days after prepared again for Execution, and took a large Snip off; when, says I, how can I tell whether I can shave after all, I have not tried yet, and if I can't, how much more ridiculous shall I look with stubbed Hair here and there, than with this comely Beard? I must say, I never in my Life had so long a Debate with myself; it holding upwards of two Months, varying, almost every time I thought of it: Till one Day, dressing myself in a Suit I had not before tried on, and looking in the Glass; it can never be, says I, that this grave Beard should suit with these fine Cloaths: No, I will have it off I am resolved. I had no sooner given another good Snip, than spying the Cloak, I had a mind to see how I looked in that: Ay, says I, now I see I must either wear this Beard, or not this Cloak. How majestick does it look? So rage, so grave, it denotes Wisdom, and Solidity; and if they already think well of me, don't let me be Fool enough to relinquish my Claim to that, for a gay Coat. I had no sooner fixed on this, than I took up all the Implements to put again into the Chest; and the last of them being the Glass, I would have one more Look, before I parted with it: But, my 
[Page 5]
Beard made such a horrid, frightful Figure, with the three great Cuts in it, that, tho' it grieved me to think I must part with it just when I had come to a Resolution to preserve it, I fell to work with my Scissars, and off it came; and after two or three Trials, I became very expert with my Rasor. 
Winter coming on, as I knew I must soon have more Occasion than ever for a Stock of Provision, from the Increase of Mouths I expected; I laid in a Stock for a little Army, and when the Hurry of that was over, I kept a sharp Look-out upon the Level, in Expectation of my Company; and had once a mind to have brought my Tent thither, to entertain them in: But it was too much trouble for the Hands I had, so I dropp'd the Design. I took one or other of the Children with me every Day, and grew more and more uneasy, at hearing nothing of them; and, as uncertain Attendance naturally breeds Thoughtfulness, and the Hours in no Employ pass so leisurely, as in that; my Mind, presaged numberless intervening Accidents, that might, if not intirely prevent their coming, at least postpone it. 
Thinks I, and that I fixed for my Standard, Youwarkee, I'm sure, would come if she could; but then, says I, here is a long Flight, and to be undertaken by an old Man too, for I thought my Father-in-Law much older than I afterwards found him, who is now safe, and quiet at home; and 
[Page 6]
having his Daughter with him, is no doubt desirous of continuing so: Now what cares he for my Uneasiness, he can find one Pretence or other, no doubt, of drilling on the Time till the dark Weather is over; and then, forsooth, it will be too light to come; and thus shall I be hung up in Suspence for another Year: Or what if my Brother, as he called himself, for he may be no more a Brother of mine, than the Pope's, for aught I know, came only on a Pretence, to see how I went on; and not finding, for all his sham Compliments to me, his Sister married to his Father's liking, should advise him not to send my Wife back again; and so all the Trouble I have had on their Account, should only prove a standing Monument of my foolish Credulity! Nay, it is not impossible, but as I have already had one Message, to inform me Tommy and Hallycarnie are provided for, as much as to say, in plain English, I shall see them no more, so I may soon have another, by some sneaking Puppy or other, whom I suppose I am to treat for the News, to tell me, my Wife, and Patty are provided for too, and I am to thank my kind Benefactors, for taking so great a Charge off my Hands. Am I? No; I'll first set my Tent, Cloaths, Chairs, and all other Mementos of my Stupidity on fire, and by perishing, what's left of us, in the Blaze, exterminate at once the wretched Remains of a deserted Family. I hate to be made a Fool of. 

[Page 7]
I had scarce finished my Soliloquy, when I heard a monstrous sort of Groan, or Growl in the Air, like Thunder at a Distance. What's that, Pedro, says I? I never heard the like before, Daddy, says he. Look about Boy, says I, do you see any thing? We heard it again; Hark! says Pedro, it comes from that End of the Lake. While we were listening to the third Sound, says Pedro, Daddy, yonder is something black upon the Rock, I did not see just now. Why? it moves, says I, Pedro, here is News, good or bad. Hope the best, Daddy, says Pedro, I wish it may be Mammy. No, says I, Pedro, I don't expect her before I hear from her. Why then, says Pedro, here they come; I can plainly descern three of them. If my Brother Tommy should be there, Daddy? No, says I, Pedro, no such good News; they tell me, Tommy's provided for, and that's to suffice for the Loss of my Child: And yet, Pedro, if I could get you settled in England, in some good Employ, I should consent to that; but what Tommy's to be, I know not. 
By this time, the three Persons were so near, that seeing us, they called out, Peter; and I, making Signs for them to alight, they settled just before me, and told me, that Pendlehamby, and Youwarkee would be with me by Light next Day. 
I had no sooner heard this, but so far was I from firing my Tent, that I invited them to my Grotto, set the best Cheer before them, and with 
[Page 8]
Over-haste to do more than one thing at once, I even left undone, what I might have done. 
I asked them, who came with my Father? and they told me, about two hundred Guards: That knocked me up again, as I had but prepared for about sixty; thinks I, my Scheme is all untwisted. I then asked them, what loud Noise it was, and if they heard it, just before I saw them over the Rock. They told me, they heard only the Gripsack [Trumpet] they brought with them, to distinguish them from ordinary Messengers; and then one of them shewed it me, for I had before only taken it for a long Staff in his Hand: But, says he, you will hear them much louder To-morrow, and longer, before they come to you. 
Having entertained them to their Content, I sent them to rest, not chusing to ask any Questions; for I avoided anticipating the Pleasure of hearing all the News from Youwarkee herself. However, the Boys and I prepared what Provisions of Fowl and Fish we could in the Time, to be ready cold, against they came, and then lay down ourselves.

CHAP. II. 

Peter settles the Formality of his Father's Reception; Description of their March, and alighting, receives his Father; conducts him to the Grotto; offers to beg Pardon for his Marriage; is prevented by Pendlehamby; Youwarkee not known in English Habit; Quarters the Officers in the Tent. 
My Mind ran so all Night upon settling the Formality with which I should receive Pendlehamby, that I got little or no Rest. In the Morning I spread my Table in as neat a manner as I could, and having dressed myself, Pedro, Jemmy, and David, we marched to the Plain; myself carrying a Chair, and each of them a Stool. I was dressed in a Cinnamon-coloured Gold-button Coat, Scarlet Waistcoat, Velvet Breeches, white Silk Stockings, the Campain-wig flowing, a Gold-laced Hat and Feather, Point Cravat, Silver Sword, and over all my Cloak: As for my Sons, they had the Cloaths my Wife made before she went. 
When we heard them coming, I marshalled the Children in the Order they were to sit, and charged them to do as they saw me do; but to keep rather a half Pace backwarder than me; and then sitting down in my Chair, I ordered Pedro to his Stool 
[Page 10]
on my Right-hand, and Jemmy to his on my Left, and David to the Left of Jemmy. 
I then sent two of the Messengers to meet them, with Instructions to let Youwarkee know where I waited for them, that they might alight at a small Distance before they came to me. This she having communicated to her Father, the Order ran through the whole Corps immediately, when and where to alight. 
It will be impossible for me, by Words, to raise your Ideas adequate to the Grandeur of the Appearance this Body of Men made, coming over the Rock; but, as I perceive your Curiosity is on the Stretch to comprehend it, I shall faintly aim at gratifying you. 
After we had heard, for some time, a Sound as of distant rumbling Thunder, or of a thousand Bears in Consort, serenading in their hoarsest Voices, we could just perceive, by the Clearness of the Dawn gilding the Edge of the Rock, a black Stream arise above the Summit of it, seemingly about forty Paces broad; when the Noise increasing very much, the Stream arose broader and broader; and then you might perceive Rows of Poles, with here and there a Streamer; and as soon as ever the main Body appeared above the Rock, there was such an universal Shout, as rent the Air, and echoing from the opposite Rock, returned the Salute to them again. This was succeeded with a most ravishing Sound of Voices, 
[Page 11]
in Song, which continued till they came pretty near me; and then the first Line, consisting of all the Trumpets, mounting a considerable Height, and still blowing, left Room for the next Ranks, about twenty a-breast, to come forward beneath them; each of which dividing in the Middle, alighted in Ranks, at about twenty Paces Distance from my Right and Left, making a Lane before me, at the farther End of which Pendlehamby and his two Daughters alighted, with about twenty of his Guards behind them; the Remainder, consisting of about twenty more, coming forward over my Head, and alighting behind me; and during this whole Ceremony, the Gripsacks sounded with such a Din, it was astonishing. 
Poor Youwarkee, who knew nothing of my Dress, or of the Loss of my Beard, was Thunderstruck when she saw me, not being able to observe any Visage I had, for my great Wig, and Hat; but putting a good Face on the matter, and not doubting, but if the Person she saw was not me, she should soon find her Husband, for she knew the Children by their Cloaths, she came forward at her Father's Right-hand, I sitting as great as a Lord, till they came within about thirty Paces of my Seat; and then gravely rising, I pulled off my Hat, and made my Obeisance; and again, at ten Steps forwarder: So that I made my third low Bow, close at the Feet of Pendlehamby; the Children all doing the same. I then kneeling with 
[Page 12]
one Leg, embraced his Right-knee; who raising me up, embraced me. Then retiring three Steps, and coming forward again, I embraced Youwarkee, some time; during which, the Children observed my Pattern with Pendlehamby, who took them up, and kissed them. 
I whispered Youwarkee, to know if any more of her Relations were in the Train, to whom I ought to pay my Compliments; she told me, only her Sister Hallycarnie, just behind her Father: I then saluted her, and stepping forward to the old Gentleman's Left-hand, I ushered him thro' the Lines of Guards to my Chair; where I caused him to sit down, with Youwarkee, and Hallycarnie on each side, and myself on the left of Hallycarnie. 
After expressing the great Honour done me by Pendlehamby in this Visit; I told him, I had a little Grotto, about half a Mile thro' the Wood, to which if he pleased to command, we would retire; for I had only placed that Seat, to relieve him, immediately upon his Descent. 
Pendlehamby rose, and all the Gripsacks sounded; he leading Youwarkee in his Right-hand, and I Hallycarnie in mine. 
At the Grotto, my Father being seated, taking Youwarkee in my Hand, we paid our Obedience to him. I would have asked his Pardon, for taking his Daughter to Wife without his Leave, and was going on in a set Speech, I had studied for the Purpose: But he refused to hear me, telling me I 
[Page 13]
was mistaken, he had consented. I was replying, I knew he had been so good to pass it over, but that would not excuse-when he again interrupted me, by saying, if I approve it, and esteem you, what can you desire more; so, finding the Subject ungrateful, I desisted. 
I then gave each of them a silver Can of Madiera, and Youwarkee retired. I soon made an Excuse to follow her, to learn if she was pleased with what I had done. Says she, my dearest, what is come to you; I'll promise you, but for fear of surprizing my Father, I had disowned you for my Husband. Dear Youwee, says I, do you approve my Dress, for this is the English Fashion. This, Peter, says she, I perceived attracted all Eyes to you, and indeed is very showy, and I approve it in regard to those we are now to please; but, you are not to imagine I esteem you more in this, than your own old Jacket; for it is Peter I love, in this, and all things else; but step in again, I shall only dress, and come to you. 
My Wife, being dressed in her English Gown, just crossed the Room where my Father sat, to see Dicky, who was in another side Room. I was then setting by, and talking with him. Son, says my Father, I understood you had no other Woman in this Arkoe, but my Daughter; for surely, you have no Child so tall as that, pointing to my Wife. No Sir, said I, that is a Friend. Is she come to 
[Page 14]
you, says he, in my Daughter's Absence? O Sir, says I, she is very well known to my Wife. 
Whilst we were talking, in comes Youwarkee, with the Child in her Arms, which she kept covered to her Wrists, with her Gown-sleeve, to hide her Graundee; and, playing with the Child, talked only English to it. Is this your youngest Son? says my Father. I told him yes. Pray Madam, says I, bring the Child to my Father. Madam, says he, you have a fine Baby in your Arms, has his Mother seen him since she came home? He speaking this in his own Tongue, and Youwarkee looking at me, as if she could not understand him, I interpreted it to her. My Sister then desired to see the Child, but I was forced again to interpret, there too. In short, they both talked with my Wife near half an Hour, but neither of them knew her; till at last, saying in her own Language, that is your Grand-daddy, my dear Dicky; the old Gentleman smoked her out; I'll be slit, says he, if that is not Youwarkee. Its impossible, says Hallycarnie. Indeed Sister, says Youwarkee, you are mistaken; and my Father, protesting he had not the least Suspicion of her, till she spoke in his Tongue, rose, and kissing her, and the Child, desired her to appear in that Habit during his Stay. 
I asked Pedro what Provision had been made for the Guards. Son, says my Father, I bring not this Number of People to eat you up; they 
[Page 15]
have their Subsistance with them; and he would by no means suffer me to allow them any. I then desired to know if there were any Officers, or others, to whom he would have shewn any particular Marks of Distinction. Son, says the old Glumm, you seem to have studied Punctillios; and tho' I should be sorry to incommode you for their sakes, if you could procure some Shelter, and Sleep-room, for about twenty of them, who are Superiors, ten at a time, while the rest are on Duty, I should be glad. I told him, I had purposely erected a Tent, which would, with great ease, accomodate a greater number; and as they were of Distinction, with his Leave, I insisted upon providing for them; to which, with some Reluctance, I procured his Consent. 
When Pendlehamby was refreshed, he would go with me, to see the Officers Quarters; and shewing him my Tent, he, having never seen such a thing before, was going to climb up the Out-side of it, taking it for Earth. Hold Sir, said I, you can't do so: Then taking him to the Front of it, I turned aside the blue Cloth, and desired him to walk in; at which he seemed wonderfully pleased, and asked me how it was made. I told him, in as few Words as I could; but he understood so little of it, that any thing else I had said, might have done as well. He mightily approved it, and calling the chief Officer, told him, that was their Quarters. Then, turning to the Officer, I desired he would 
[Page 16]
command my House, and that Provision should be supplied to his Quarters daily; at which, he hesitating; I assured him, I had my Father's Leave for what I offered; whereupon, he stroked his Chin. 
I then asked him, if he had any clever Fellows under him, to serve them, and dress their Provisions; but, he hoped, he said, they were ready dressed, as his Men knew little of that Matter; but for any other piece of Service, as many as I pleased, should be at my Command. 

[Page 17]

CHAP. III. 

The Manner of their Dinner; believe the Fish and Fowl to be Fruits; hears his Brother and the Colambs are coming; Account of their lying; Peter's Reflections on the want of the Graundee; they view the Arkoe; Servants harder to please than their Masters; Reason for different Dresses the same Day. 
Pendlehamby, having a mind to view my Arkoe, took a long Walk with Hallycarnie in the Wood, till Dinner-time; and, he having before told me, that some of his Guards always waited on him at Meals; I ordered their Dinner before his Return, sending a large Dish of cold Fowls, cut into Joints, into the Tent, to be spread on clean Leaves I had laid on the Chests, and setting a sufficient Quantity of Bread, and Fish there also, I desired the Officers present to refesh themselves now; and the rest, when relieved, should have a fresh Supply. I saw there was an Oddity in their Countenances, which at first, I did not comprehend; but presently turning about to the Superior, Sir, says I, tho' this Food may look unusual to you, it is what my Island affords, and you'll be better reconciled to it, after tasting: So, taking a Piece of Fowl, and dipping it in the Salt, I eat a bit myself, and recommended another to him; who, eating it, they 
[Page 18]
all fell to without further Scruple: Above all things commending the Salt, as what they had never tasted the like of before, tho' they thought they had, both of the Fish, and Fowl. 
I then told them where my Supply of Water came from, and that they must furnish themselves with that, by their own Men. 
Upon the Return of my Father, and Sister, the Gripsack sounded for Dinner; when four Officers on Duty, entring, desired, as their Posts, to have the serving up of the Dishes; one of them, I perceived, having set on the first Dish, never stirred from behind Pendlehamby; but upon his least Word, or Sign, ordered the others what to do, or bring, which he only presented to my Father; and he frequently gave him a Piece from his own Plate; but the other Officers served at the Table promiscuously. 
After Dinner, I brought in a Bowl of Punch; when, begging leave to proceed in my Country Method, I drank to my Father's Health. So, Daughter, says he to my Wife, we are at the old Game again. Son, says he, this is no Novelty to me, Youwarkee constantly drinking to the Health of her dear Peter, and the Children at Grandevolet, and obliging us, to pledge her, as she called it; but I thank you, and will return your Civility: So, taking a Glass, Son and Daughter, says he, long Life, Love, and Unity attend you, and my Grandchildren. Youwarkee, and I, both rising till he had done, returned him our Thanks. 

[Page 19]
When we had sat some time, Son, says my Father, you and your Wife having lived so retired, I fear my Company, and Attendants, must put you to an Inconvenience: Now; as my Son intends you a Visit also, in Company with several of my Brother Colambs; if we shall be too great a Load upon you, declare it, for they will be at Battingdrig Arkoe To-morrow, to know whether it will be agreeable for them to proceed. 
You know Son, says my Father, the Mouth is a great Devourer, and that the Stock your Family can't consume in a Year, by multiplying their Numbers may be reduced in a Day; now freely let me know, for you say you provided for us, how your Stock stands; that you may not only pleasure us, but we not injure you. 
I told him, as for dried Fish, I had a vast Quantity, and that my Fowls were so numerous, I knew not my Stock; as to Bread, I had a great deal, and might have almost what more I would; and then for fresh Fish, the whole Province of Arndrumstake could not soon devour them; but for my Pickles, and Preserves, I had neither such large Quantities, or Conveniencies to bestow them, if I had. 
If this be the Case Son, says my Father, I may send your Brother Word to proceed; and dispatched ten Messengers with a Gripsack, to hasten his Son's Arrival. 

[Page 20]
It now began to be time for Rest, and the old Gentleman growing pretty mellow, with the Punch; which, by the hearty Pulls he took at it, I perceived was no disagreeable Entertainment to him; I conducted him to his Repose, and disposing of the rest of the Family, Youwarkee and I, with great Impatience retired. 
You may imagine, I was sincerely glad to find myself once more alone with my Youwarkee; when, after a Transport of mutual Endearments, I desired to know how Pendlehamby first received her; which she told me, with every Circumstance, in so affecting a Manner, that the Tears forced Passage from my Eyes, in perfect Streams, and I loved the dear Man ever after, as my own Father. 
She told me, Tommy was in great Favour at Court, before her Brother returned from me; but, ever since I sent him the Flagellet, he had been caressed above measure, and would soon be a great Man. That Hallycarnie, was a constant Attendant on Jahamel, both in her Diversions, and Retirement; and she did not doubt, would in time, marry very well. As for Patty, she said her Father intended, with my Leave, to adopt her his own Child. 
My Wife slept very sound after her Journey; but, my Hurry of Spirits denying me that Refreshment, I never, so much as now, lamented the want of the Graundee; for thinks I, now I have once again tasted the Sweets of Society, how shall 
[Page 21]
I ever relish a total Desertion of it, which in a few Days must be the Case, when all this Company are fled, and myself am reduced to my old Jacket, and Water-cart again. Now, if I was as others here are, I might make a better Figure than they, by my superior Knowledge of things, and have the World my own: Nay, I would fly to my own Country, or to some other part of the World; where, even the Strangeness of my Appearance would procure me a good Subsistance. But, says I, if with my Graundee I should loose my Sight, or only be able to live in the Dark in England? why I should be full as bad as I am here; for no Body would be able to keep me Company abroad, as my Hours for the Air would be theirs of Retirement; and then, at home, it would be much the same; no one would prefer my Company in a dark Room, in the Day-time, when they could enjoy others in the Light of the Sum; then, how should I be the better for the Graundee? Unless I fixed a Resolution of living here, or here-abouts; and then, to get into Company, I must retire to still darker Regions, which my Eyes are no ways adapted to; in short, I must be quite new moulded, new made, and new born too, before I can attain my Desires. Therefore, Peter, says I, be content, you have been happy here, in your Wife and Children without these things; then never make yourself so wretched, as to hope for a Change which can never possibly happen, and which, 
[Page 22]
perhaps, if obtained, might undo you; but, intend only what you can compass, by weighing all Circumstances, and your Felicity will lie in very narrow Bounds; free, from two of the greatest Evils a Man can be beset by, Hopes, and Fears; two inseperable Companions, and deadly Enemies to Peace: For a Man is destroyed by Hope, thro' Fear of Disappointment. This brought me a Shew of Peace again; surely, says I, I am one of the most unaccountable amongst Mankind: I never can reflect, till I am worn down with Vexation. O Glaulepze, Glaulepze! says I, I shall never forget thy Speech after engaging the Crocodile; that every thing was to be attained by Resolution, by him that takes both Ends of a thing in his View at once, and fairly deliberates what may be given, and taken, from End to End. Surely, says I, this ought to be engraven on Brass, as I wish it was on my Heart; it would prevent me many painful Hours, help me with more Ease to compass attainable Ends, and to rest contented, under Difficulties insuperable: And, if I live to rise again, I will place it, where it shall never more be out of my Sight, and will enforce it, not only more and more on myself, but on my Children. 
With this Thought, I dropped on Sleep, and with this, I awaked again; and the first thing I did, was to find a proper Place to write it, which, having fixed for the Door of my Cupboard, I took a burnt Stick, for my Pencil, and wrote as follows. 
[Page 23]
"" This, I wrote first in English, and then in the Doorpt Swangcantine Tongue; and, having read it twice or thrice over, I went for Water, and Fish, and returned before the Family were up. 
I took care To-day also, that the Officers should be as well served as possible, and where an Accomodation must be wanting, I rather chose to let it fall on my Father, than on them; for I had ever observed it to be an easier thing, to satisfy the Master than the Man; as the Master weighs Circumstances, and from a natural Complaisancy in himself, puts a humane Construction upon that Error, or Omission, which the Servant wholly attributes to Slight, and Neglect. 
My Company being abroad, about the Time I expected their Return, I dressed myself as the Day before, only without my Cloak, and in a black Bob-wig; and took a Turn to meet them. 
Pendlehamby, spying me first among the Trees, Daughter Youwarkee, says he, you have an Husband, I think, for every Day in the Week; who's this, my Son Peter? Why, he is not the same Man he was Yesterday. She told him, she had heard me say, we changed our Apparel almost every Day in England; nay, sometimes twice, or 
[Page 24]
thrice the same Day. What? says Pendlehamby, are they so mischievous there, they are fearful of being known in the latter, by those who saw them in the former Part of the Day? 
By this time I was come up, and after paying due Compliments, says Youwarkee, my Father did not know you, my Dear, you are so altered in your other Wig; and I told him, in your Country, they not only change Wigs, but their whole Cloathing, two or three times a Day, sometimes. Son, says my Father, if it be so, I can't guess at the Design, of a Man's making himself, unlike himself. O, Sir, says I, it is owing to the different Functions he is to perform, that Day: As suppose, in the Morning he is to pursue Business, with his Inferiors, or meet at our Cofee-Houses, to hear, and chat over the News of the Day: He appears in a light, easy Habit, proper for Dispatch, and comes home dirty. Then, perhaps, he is to dine with a Friend at Mid-day; before whom, for Respect's sake, not chusing to be seen in his dirty Dress, he puts on something handsomer; and, after spending some time there; he has, it may be, an Appointment at Court, a Play, or with his Mistress; in all which last Cases, if he has any thing better than ordinary, it is a part of good Breeding to appear in that: But, if the very best was to be used in common, it might soon become the worst, and not fit for a nice Man to stir abroad in. The different Custom of Countries, you have 
[Page 25]
told me of, says my Father, is surprizing. Here are we born with our Cloaths on, which always fit, be we ever so small, or large; nay, are never the worse for constant wearing; and you must be eternally altering, and changing Colour, Shape, and Habit: But, says he, where do they get all these things? Does every Man make just what he likes? No, says I, there are a particular Set of Men, whose Business it is to make for all the rest. What? says he, I suppose their Lasks [Slaves] make them. No Sir, they are Filgays, [Freeman] says I. It is their Trade, they do it for a Livelihood, being paid by them they work for. A Suit of these Cloaths, says I, taking up the Flap of my Coat, will cost what we call twelve or fourteen Pounds in Money. I don't understand you, says he. Why Sir, says I, that is as much, as will provide one moderate Man with all the necessary things of Life for two Months. Then, says he, these nice Men must be very rich. No, Sir, said I, there you are under a Mistake; for if a Man, very rich, and who is known to be so, neglects his Habit, it is taken to be his Choice; but, one who is not known to be rich, and is really not so, is by appearing gay sometimes thought to be so; for he comes little abroad, and pinches miserably at home; first to get that gay Suit, and then acts on the same part to preserve it; till some lucky hit may help him to the Means of getting another; 
[Page 26]
as it frequently happens, by a good Marriage: For tho' he is but seldom seen in public, yet always appearing so fine when he is, the Ladies, whose Fancies are frequently more tickled with Shew than Sense, admitting him only at first as a Companion, are at last, if worth any thing, taken in the Toils he is ever spreading for them; and, becoming his Wife, produce a standing Fund to make him a rich Man in reality, which he but personated before. 
Pendlehamby could not well understand all I said; and I found by him, that all the Riches they possessed were only Food and Slaves; and, as I found afterwards when amongst them, they know the want of nothing else: But, I am afraid, I have put them upon another way of thinking, tho' I aimed at what we call civiziling of them. 

[Page 27]

CHAP. IV. 

Quangrallort arrives with the Colambs; streightned for Accommodation; remove to the Tent; Youwarkee not known; Peter relates Part of his Travels; Dispute about the Beast-Fish Skins. 
Sleeping longer than usual, I was awakened next Morning by a Gripsack from Quangrallort; upon hearing of which, I roused immediately, thinking they were at my Door; but the Messenger told me, they could not be there in what I understood by his Signs to be about two Hours; for they have no such Measure for Time, as Hours: So I dressed at leisure, and then went to Youwarkee, and waked her; Youwee, says I, your Brother will be here presently, and I having a mind you should appear as my Country-woman, would have you dress yourself. 
We walked down to the Level, and but just saved our Distance; for the Van of them were within the Arkoe before we arrived, and with such a Train after them, as seemed to reach the whole Length of the Arkoe. The Regularity and Order of their Flight was admirable, and the Break of the Trumpets so great, sounding all the way they came, (for we had not only one Set of them, but at least thirty, there being so many 
[Page 28]
Colambs and petty Princes in the Train, each with fifty Attendants) that I wondered how they could bear it. As the Principals alighted, which was at least an hundred Paces from me, the Gripsacks still kept Wing, sounding as long as we stayed. 
This, was a very tedious Ceremony, for the Guards alighting with their Colambs, ranged just as Pendlehamby's had done, but reached as far as the Eye could see. As they moved towards us, Youwarkee, and I, having stood still some time, moved slowly forward to meet them. 
It would have surprized you, to have seen the Deference they paid us; and, I believe, the Guards took us for something above the mortal Race. Youwarkee shewed no part of her Graundee, having her Sleeves down to her Wrists, white Silk Stockings, and red-heeled Shoes; so that none of them knew her for one of them. 
The first that we met was my Brother, to whom we had only an Opportunity of paying our Compliments en passant, before another Grandee came up, who was succeeded by another, and another, to the number of thirty; some out of Respect to my Father and Brother, and some out of mere Curiosity to see me; and as fast as each had paid his Salutes, he passed us, till we found we had no more to meet; when we turned about, and fell in with the Company. 

[Page 29]
When we came to the Grotto, I was very much put to it for Room, we scarce being able to stand upright by each other, much less to sit down; which my Father perceiving, my dear Friends, says he, had my Son known, in time, of so much good Company, he would have been better provided with Seats for us all; but considering all we see is the Labour only of his own Hands, we should rather admire at the many Conveniencies we see here, than be uneasy there are no more: And, Son, says he, as we are now so large a Body, I propose that we adjourn to the Officers Quarters, and let them take ours. I returned my Father Thanks for the Hint, and led the way, the rest following; where we found Room enough and to spare. 
Tho' Youwarkee was with us all Dinner-time, helping the Guests, we had no sooner done, but says Quangrallort, aloud, Brother Peter, are we not to see my Sister? I not hearing perfectly what he said, tho' I perceived he spoke to me; Sir, says I. My Sister Youwarkee, says he, why won't she appear? here are several of her good Friends, as well as myself, will be glad to see her. My Father then laughed so heartily, that the rest taking notice of it, my poor Brother was put to the Blush. Son, says my Father, don't you know your own Sister? We have not seen her yet, says one of the Colambs, or any Lady, but your Daughter Hallycarnie, and that Attendant. 
[Page 30]
My Brother, then seeing how it was, came up to salute my Wife; but even then had his Scruples, till he saw her smile; and then begged Pardon for his Oversight, as did all the Colambs, upon saluting her: My Brother declaring, that as she was somewhat behind me on the Level, he had only paid her the Respect of his Chin, taking her for some one attending me. The Colamb following my Brother, assured her, the little Regard shewn her by Quangrallort, who he thought should know best where to bestow his Respects, was the Reason of his taking no more Notice of her; and each, confessing his Mistake arose from too nearly copying the Steps of his immediate Predecessor, they all made excuse, and the Mistake made us very merry, till they proposed taking a Turn in the Woods, it being a great Novelty to them, they said; but I begged they would leave me behind, to prepare for their Return. 
Having refreshed themselves after they came home, Quangrallort, being put upon it by some of the Colambs, told me, I could not render a more acceptable Favour to the whole Company, than to relate to them an Account of my Adventures; for tho', says he, I told them last Night what I remembered to have heard from you; yet the Variety was so great, I could not deliver the Facts in Order, as I heard them, but was obliged to take here a-piece, and there another, as they 
[Page 31]
occurred to me, making rather several Stories of it, than a continued Series of Facts. 
All the Colambs immediately seconded the Motion, and desired me to begin. I then ordering a clear Table, and a Bowl of Punch, and having drank all the Company's Healths, began my Narration, hoping to have finished it before Bedtime; but they pressing me to be very particular, and frequently one or other requiring Explanations upon particular Facts; and then one making a Remark upon something, which another answering, and a third replying to; they got the Talk out of my Hands, so long, that having lost themselves in the Argument, and forgot what I said last, they begged my Pardon, and desired me to go on: When one, who in Contemplation of one Fact had lost best part of another, prayed me to go on from such an Incident, and another from one before that; so that I was frequently obliged to begin, half way back again. This Method not only spun out my Story to a very great Length, but instead of its being finished that Evening, as I had purposed, it was scarce well begun before Bed-time drew on: So I just having brought them to Angola, told them, as it grew late, if they pleased, I would finish the Remainder next Night; which they agreed to. 
Quangrallort then asked my Father, if he had been fishing since he came; but he told him, he knew not what he meant. Then all the Company 
[Page 32]
desired I would shew them what that was. I told them they might command me as they pleased; so we appointed the next Morning for that Exercise; but, Gentlemen, says I, your Lodging to Night gives me the greatest Pain; for I know not what I shall do about that. I have a sew Beast-Fish Skins, which are very soft and hairy, but not a Sufficiency for so many Friends as I would at present be proud to oblige: But I can lay them as far as they will go, upon as much dry Reeds and Grass as you please. I then sent a Servant to Youwarkee for the Skins; after which, they one and all crying out, if they had but good dry Reeds, they desired no better Lodging: I dispatched Hands, to bring away a large Parcel of it to the Tent; which they did in a trice. Then waiting on those few who lay at the Grotto to their Quarters, and having sent Youwarkee to her Sister, I returned to the Tent, to take up my own Lodging with those I had left there. 
I had not yet entred the Tent, when I heard a perfect Tumult within, every one talking so loud, and all together, that I verily thought they had fallen out, and were going to Handy-cuffs; however, I resolved to go in amongst them, and try to compose their Difference: When just entring, and they spying me, several ran to me, with each a Skin in his Hand, the rest following as fast as they could. Gentlemen, says I, I hoped to have found you all at Rest. So we 
[Page 33]
should have been, says one of them, but for these, what you call 'ems. It is my unspeakable Misfortune, says I, that I have no more at your Service, and am sorry I should cause them to be brought, since each of you can't have one. Says one of them, I don't want one, I have seen enough of it. Then, Gentlemen, says I, it is possible there may be so many more of that Colamb's Mind, that there may be sufficient for those who desire them. They neither knew what to make of me, or I of them, all this while; till an old Colamb perceiving our Mistake, Mr. Peter, says he, we have only had a Dispute-I am sorry at my Heart for it, says I; but I perceived you were very warm, before I entred, and am in great Hopes of compromising Matters, to all your Satisfactions. I was going, says the same Colamb, to tell you we had a Dispute about what these Things were, nothing else. I was then struck on a Heap, being quite ashamed they should think I suspected they had been quarrelling for the Skins; and how to come of, I knew not. You'll excuse me Sir, says I, for expressing a Concern that you could not each have one, to examine into at the same time, that one of you need not have waited to make your Remarks, till the other had done. No Occasion, no Occasion for that, Mr. Peter, said they all together; we shall have Leisure enough to examine them to-morrow; but we want to know what they 
[Page 34]
are, and where they grow. Gentlemen, says I, each of these is the Cloathing of a particular Fish. And where do they grow, said they? In the Lake, says I; they are a living Creature, who inhabit that great Water; I often catch them when I am fishing; the same Exercise we shall go upon to-morrow. 
I had much ado to persuade them they did not grow on Trees, which I was then much more surprized at, than some time after, that I returned their Visit: But having satisfied them, and given them some possible Hopes they might see one alive next Day, they were very well contented; and we all lay down to Rest.

CHAP. V. 

Go a fishing; catch a Beast-Fish; afraid of the Gun; how Peter altered his Net; a Fish-dinner for the Guards; Method of dressing and eating it. 
I appeared before them in the Morning in my old Jacket, and an old Hat with Brims indented almost to the Crown, a Flannel Nightcap, and checker'd Shirt. How now Son? says my Father, what have we here? Sir, says I, this will shew you the Use of our English Fashion I mentioned the other Day, and the Necessity of it. You see me in this indifferent Habit, because my next Business requires it; but when I come back, and have no further Dirty-work to do, I shall then dress, as near as I can, to qualify me for your Company. 
Are you for moving Gentlemen? says my Brother; I believe it is time: They then all arising, we went to the Lake; where getting into my Boat, and telling them, that any six of them might go with me, they, never having seen such a thing before, and not much liking the Looks of it, all made Excuses; till my Brother, assuring them it was very safe, and that he had sailed in it the last Trip, three or four of them, with my Father, and Hallycarnie, who was very 
[Page 36]
desirous of seeing me fish, got in; and we sailed a great way up the Lake, taking my Gun as usual with me. 
It gave me exceeding Delight, to see the whole Body of the People then in the Arkoe on the Graundee; some hovering over our Heads, and talking with us; others flying this way, others that, till I had pitched upon a Spot to begin my Operation; when rowing to Shoar, and quitting my Boat, the whole Body of People settled just by me, staring at me and my Net, and wondering what I was doing. I then taking a Sweep as usual, got some of the Soldiers to assist me to Shoar with it; but, when the Cod of the Net landed, and the Fish began to dash with their Tails at the Water's Edge, away ran all my Soldiers, frighted out of their Wits to think what was coming: But it being a large Hale, and a shelving Bank, I could not lift it to the Level myself; which, my Brother, who had seen the Sport before, perceiving, tho' not one of the rest stirred, lent me a Hand, and we got it up. 
You can't imagine, what Surprize appeared in every Face upon opening the Net, and seeing all the Fish naked; they drew up by degrees closer and closer, for I let the Fish lie some time for their Observation; but seeing the large Fish, upon my handling them, flap their Tails, they very expeditiously retired again. I then, tossed several of them into the Boat; but two of them 
[Page 37]
being very large, and rough-scaled ugly Fish, I did not think I could lift them myself, so desired Assistance; but no body stirred: I expected some of the Colambs would have ordered their Men to have helped me; but they were so terrified with seeing me handle them, that they could not have the Conscience to order their Men on so severe a Duty, till a common Man came to me, and taking the Tail, and I the Head, we tossed them both into the Boat. 
I went higher up the Lake than usual, in hopes of a Beast-Fish, to shew them; but, tho' I could not meet with one, I had several very great Hales, and took three or four of my Lobsters, very large ones. This was the second Trial I had made of my Net, since I had altered it, and gave me great Satisfaction; for I could now take as many Fish at one Draught, as I could before have done at ten; I had found, that tho' my Net was very long, yet for want of a Bag, or Cod to inclose the Fish, many that were included within its Compass would, whilst I drew round, swim to the Extreams, and so get out, for want of some Inlet to enter at; for which reason, I sawed off the Top of a Tree, at about ten Feet from the Ground, and drawing a Circle of six Feet Diameter round the Tree, on the Ground, I stuck it round with small Pegs, at two Inches Distance; then I drove the like Number of Nails round the Top of the Trunk of the Tree, 
[Page 38]
and straining a Length of Matline from each Peg on the Ground to a correspondent Nail on the Tree, I tied my Matline in Circles round the strained Lines, from Top to Bottom, about two Inches Distance at the Bottom, but at a less Distance where the strained Lines grew nearer to each other towards the Top; and having secured all the Ends, by some Line twisted round them, I cut a Hole in the Middle of my Net, and tied the large Ground End over the Hole in the Net, and gathered the small End up in a Purse, tying it up tight; and by this means, I now scarce lost any Fish, which once were within the Sweep of my Net. 
Having had so good Success, I had a Design of returning; but thought, as I could now so easily entertain a Multitude, I might as well take another Hale or two, and make an handsome Treat for the Soldiery: Then coming up to my Drill's Mouth, I fixed my Implements for a Draft there, and beginning to draw up, I found great Resistance in the Net, and got two or three to help me; but, coming near Shoar, when the Company saw the Net tumble and roll, and rise and fall, they all ran as if they were mad; till I called them, and told the Colambs, it was only one of the Fish whose Skins I had shewn them; upon which, by that time I had discharged the Fish from the Net, they were all round me again. But, no sooner had he got loose, than up he rose, 
[Page 39]
whirled his Wings, and at the same Instant uttered such a Groan, that my whole Company retreated again, thinking me somewhat more than a Man, who could face so dreadful an Enemy. I intreated them to come and view it; but finding no Arguments could bring them nearer, I edged round till I got him between me and the Water, and shot him dead. 
Upon the Report of my Gun, the whole Field was in the Air, darting and screaming, as I have often seen a Flight of Rooks do on the same Occasion; and I am apt to believe some of them never returned again, but went directly home. 
I was little concerned to see the Confusion I had caused; and laying down my Gun, my Brother, who tho' at a Distance when I shot, knowing what I was at, and coming up to me, it put the rest upon their Consideration; and they alighted one by one, at a Distance, till they were all on the Level again. 
My Father, and the Colambs, who were the first that durst approach, wondered what I had done, and how the Fish came to be dead, and whence so much Fire and Smoak proceeded, for they were sure I brought none with me; and asked me abundance of Questions: But, as I knew I must have Occasion for answering to the same thing twenty times over, had I entred upon an Explanation there, I deferred giving them Satisfaction till we came home; when all at 
[Page 40]
once might be capable of hearing what was said. So, I told them, the most necessary thing at present was, to stow the Fish in the Boat; for it was the largest I had ever taken, and I could not wholly do it myself. I made several Efforts for Help, but in vain; till the same Soldier who had helped me with one of the first Fish came to my Relief, and, desiring my Orders what to do, assisted me; and the rest seeing the Difficulty we both had to manage it, one or two more of them coming up, we shipped it on board. 
I then called the Colambs to me, telling them, I was sorry I had given such a general Disturbance to them, by shooting the Fish; but, as they kept at too great a Distance from me to have Notice of my Design, and if I had followed them the Fish might have escaped before my Return, I was obliged to do as I did; which was without any possibility of hurting them: But, as I had given them such a Fright, I hoped they would this one Day give me an Opportunity of complimenting their Guards with a Fish-dinner, if we could any way contrive to dress it; for whoever did that must be able to bear the close Light of a large Fire. They all shook their Heads, but my Brother; who told me, he had in his Retinue six Men from Mount Alkoe [a burning Mountain] purposely retained for their strong Sight, to attend him always to Crashdoorpt; who, he believed, for the Benefit of the rest, 
[Page 41]
would undertake the Cookery, if I would shew them how. I desired he would give them Orders to attend me on the other Side the Lake, and I would instruct them at my landing; and then I crossed over with my Booty. 
Finding the Mount Alkoe Men waiting for my landing, I asked if they could bear the Sight of Fire. They told me, they were used to much greater Light and Flames than I had ever seen, they believed. Very good, said I, then get into my Boat, three of you, and hand out that Fish to the Shore. I found they were more afraid of the Fish than of the Fire; for not one of them stirred till I got in and tossed out several small ones; and then taking up a large one, help me some body, says I, they looking a little at one another; till one of them venturing to take it, the rest fell heartily to work, and dispatched the whole Lading presently. I then laid a small Parcel upon my Cart, for our own eating, and the Officers, and sending them to the Grotto, I gave the Cooks their Charge. 
Now, says I, my Lads, do you serve all the rest of the Fish as I do this; cutting it open at the same time, and throwing away the Guts, and I will send each of you such an Instrument as I use here, pointing to my Knife. I shall order six large Heaps of Wood to the Level, to be piled up there: When you have done the Fish, 
[Page 42]
do you set fire to the Heaps, and let them burn till the Flame is over, and the Coals are clear; then lay on your Fish, and if any are too large to be managable, cut them in proper Pieces, and with Sticks, which I will send you, turn them over and over, walking round the Fire, and with the forked End of the Stick toss the least off first, and afterwards the greater; but be sure, throw the Fish as far as ever you can from the Fire, amongst the Men, that they may not be obliged to come too near it; and in this manner go on, till either they have enough, or your Fish are gone; and when you have done, come to the Grotto for your Reward. 
I then set abundance of Hands to work to carry Wood, to be laid in six Heaps, two hundred Paces from each other, and told them how to pile it. I then prepared six long taper Sticks with forked Ends, and ordered more Hands to divide the Fish equally to the Piles. I sent others with Salt, and Bread; and I ordered them to let me know when all was ready. 
While these Preparations were making, my Tent Visitors had all dined, and my Cart had returned with the Beast-Fish, which the Company desired might be brought in; when every one passed his Judgment upon it, and a long Dissertation we had, on the marvelous Works of Collwarr. I let them go on with their Show, 
[Page 43]
tho' I could have disproved most of their Conclusions, from the little Knowlege I had of things; but I never was Knight-Errant enough to oppose my Sentiments to a Multitude already prepossessed on the other Side of the Question; for this reason, because I have ever observed, that where several have imbibed the same ridiculous Principle in Infancy, they never want Arguments, tho' ever so ridiculous, to support it: And, as no one of them can desert it without impeaching the Judgment of the rest, they encourage each other in their Obstinacy, and quite out-vote a single Person; and then, the Laugh beginning on the strongest Side, nothing is so difficult as to get it out of their Hands; but when a single Man in the wrong hears a just Argument from a single Antagonist, which he can't contradict, he imbibes its Force; and whilst that lasts, as nothing but a better Argument, with better Reasons, can remove it, he from thenceforth adopts his Adversary's Reasons for his own, to oppose against his own former Opinion. 
In the Height of our Disputations on the Beast-Fish, came News that the Broil was going to begin; and, as I expected very good Diversion at it, I invited the Company to go see it, telling them, in my Opinion, it would exceed the Sport in taking them. When passed thro' the Wood till we came amongst the Shrubs, where I placed 
[Page 44]
them to be out of Harm's way; and the Fire, which was now nothing but Cinders, was of no Inconvenience to them. They were pleased with it to perfection; for first, the fix Men who walked round the Fires, by the glowing Light of the Embers and the shining of their Graundees, looked like Men on fire; then, to see each Fire surrounded with a Circle of Men, at the Diameter of near two hundred Paces, as close as they could well stand, by a more distant Shine of the Fire, had a very pleasant Effect: But, when the Broilers began to throw the Fish about, for each Man stood with some Salt and a Cut of Bread in his Hand, to see a Body of an hundred Men running for it, and whilst they were stooping and scrambling for that, to see a hot Fish fall on the Back of one, which was whipped off by another, who scalding his Mouth with it, threw it in the Face of a third, when a fourth, fifth, and sixth pulling it in Pieces ran away with it; and to see the different Postures, Courses, and Groups during this Exercise and Running-feast, was the most agreeable Farce my Guests had ever seen in their Lives; and, to the great Saving of my Liquors, kept us in the Wood for full three Hours, not a Soul stirring till the Feast was over. 
We spent best Part of this Evening in Discourse on the Passages of the Day; the Reflections on which not being concluded till Bed-time, my 
[Page 45]
Adventures were postponed till the next Night; but we had first concluded upon a Shooting for the next Morning; for they were all extreamly desirous of knowing how I did it, at a time they should have Opportunity of seeing me, and making Remarks; and I, being unwilling they should think me a Conjurer, agreed to make them Masters of Part of the Mystery of Powder and Ball. 

[Page 46]

CHAP. VI. 

A Shooting proposed; all afraid of the Gun but one private Guard; his Behaviour; Pendlehamby at Peter's Request makes him a General; Peter's Discourse thereon; Remainder of his Story; the Colambs return. 
This being the fifth Morning, I cleaned up my best Gun, and prepared my Balls, and we all took a Walk towards the Bridge, every one admiring my Gun, as we went; but I could get none of them to carry it, and we had, at least, five hundred Questions proposed about it. I told them they need not be afraid of it, for it was only Wood, and Iron; but they knew nothing of Iron. I then shewed them how I made it give Fire, by snapping the Cock; they thought it was very strange. I then put a little Powder in the Pan, and made it Flash, and shewing them the empty Pan, they would not be persuaded but I had taken away the Powder, before the Flash, or else, they said, it was impossible that should be all gone, upon flashing only; for they said it was a little Nut, using the same Word to express both Nut and Seed. I then desired one of them to put in some Powder, and snap it himself; but having prevailed with him to try the Experiment, if I had not thro' Caution held my Hand upon 
[Page 47]
the Barrel, the Gun had been on the Ground; for the Moment it flashed, he let go, and ran for it. 
I had a great Inclination to gain the better of their Prejudices, and used abundance of Arguments to prove the Gun as innocent a thing as a Twig I took up; and that it was the Powder, which when set on fire, the Flame thereof wanting more Room, than the Powder itself did, forced itself, and all that opposed it, out of the Mouth of the Gun, with such Fury as to make the Noise they heard; and being just come to the Rock, now, says I, you shall see that what I tell you is true. They told me, they desired nothing more than that I would make them understand it, for it was the strangest thing they had ever seen. Well then, says I, observe; I put in thus much Powder only, and with this Rag I stop it down close. Now, says I, you see by the Length of this Stick, that the Rag and Powder take up the Space only of a Finger's Depth on the Inside of the Gun. They saw that plainly, they said; but how could that kill any thing? Now look again, says I, I put in a little more Powder, as I did before when I made a Flash, and you see there is a little Hole from this Powder thro' the Side of the Gun to the Powder within. Do you observe that this communicates with that, thro' this Hole? Yes, they said, they did. Now, says I, when I put fire to this, it sets fire to that 
[Page 48]
within; which Fire, turning to Flame, and wanting Room, bursts out at the Mouth of the Gun: And to shew you with what Force it comes out, here handle this round Ball, giving them a Bullet to handle; you feel how heavy it is; now can any of you throw this Ball as far as that Rock? for I stood a good hundred Paces from it. They told me, no. And don't you think, says I, that if the Force of the Fire made by this Powder can throw this Ball to that Rock, that Force must be very great? They said, they thought it must; but believed it to be impossible. But, says I, if it not only throws it to the Rock, but beats out a Piece of the Stone, must not that be much more violent? They agreed it must. Then putting in the Ball, now, says I, we will try. I then ordered one to daub a Part of the Rock, about Breast high, with some Mud, and first to observe about it, if the Rock was any where fresh broken, or not; who, returning, reported that the Rock was all of a Colour, and found, but somewhat ragged all about the Mud. Did you lay the Mud on smooth, says I? He replied, yes. Then lifting up my Gun, I perceived they were creeping off; so, I took it down again, and calling, reasoned with them upon their Fears. What Mischief, says I, can you apprehend from this Gun in my Hand? Should I be able to hurt you with it, are you not all my Friends, or Relations; could I be willing to do it? If the Gun of itself 
[Page 49]
could hurt, would I handle it as I do? For shame, be more courageous, rouse your Reason, and stand by me; I shall take care not to hurt you; it looks as if you mistrusted my Love to you; for this Gun can do nothing, but what I direct it to. 
By such like Persuasions, rough and smooth, I prevailed upon the major Part of the Colambs and Officers to stand near me to see me fire; and then I shot; but tho' my Words had engaged them to stand it, I had no sooner snapped, but the Graundees flew all open, tho' they closed again immediately; and then, we fell to Question and Answer again. I desired them to walk to the Rock, and sent the Person who put up the Mark before, to see, and shew us exactly what Alteration there was; he told us, there was a round Hole in the Mud, pointing to it, which he did not leave there, and taking away the Mud, a thick Shiver of the Rock followed it. They then all agreed, that the Ball must have made both the Hole in the Mud, and also splintered the Rock; and stood in amaze at it, not being able to comprehend it: But by all the Art I had I could not prevail with a Man of them to fire the Gun himself, till it had been buzzed about a good while, and at last came to my Ears, that a common Soldier behind said he should not be afraid of it, if the Gentleman would show him how. 

[Page 50]
I then ordered the Fellow to me, and he told me, with a composed Look, that it had always been his way of thinking, that what he saw another do, he could do himself, and could not rest till he had tried: And Sir, says he, if this Gun, as you call it, does not hurt you, why should it hurt me? And if you can make it hit that Rock, why should not I? when you have told me how you manage it. Are not you the Man that first helped me up with the large Fish Yesterday, says I? He told me he was. 
I was prodigiously pleased with the Fellow's Spirit, and, says I, my Friend, if you will, and I live, you shall hit it before you have done. I then shewed him the Sight of the Gun, and how to hold it; and being perfect in that, now, says I, shut your left Eye, and observe with your Right, till this Knob, and that Notch, are exactly even with each other, and the Middle of that Mark; and when they are so, pull this Bit with your Fore-finger, holding the Gun tight to your Shoulder. He so exactly pursued my Directions, that he hit the very Middle of the Mud; and then, without any Emotion, walked up with the Gun in his Hand, as I had done before; and turning to me, very gravely, Sir, says he, it is hit. I told him, the best Marksman on Earth could not be sure of coming so near his Mark. He stroaked his Chin, and giving me the Gun again, was walking to his Place; but I stopped 
[Page 51]
him, and seeing something so modest and sincere in his Countenance and Behaviour, and so generous in his Spirit, I asked him to which Colamb he belonged. He told me to Colamb Pendlehamby. To my Father? says I, then sure I shall not be denied. 
I took him with me to my Father, who was not yet come up to the Rock. Sir, says I, there is a Favour I would beg of you. Son, says he, what is it you can ask, that I can refuse you? Says I, Sir, this Man belongs to your Guards; now there is something so noble and daring in his Spirit, and yet so meek and deserving in his Deportment, that if you will load me with Obligation, it is to make him an Officer: He is not deserving of so ill a Station as a private Man. 
My Father looking at me, Son, says he, there is something to be done before he can be qualified for what you require. This, thinks I, is a put-off. Pray Sir, says I, what can a Man of Courage, Sense, and a cool Temper want, to qualify him for what I ask? Something, says he, which none but myself can give; and that, at your desire, I will supply him with. Then, my Father calling him, Lask Nasgig bonyoe, says he, that is, Slave Nasgig lie down. Nasgig, for that was his Name, immediately fell on his Face, with his Arms, and Hands, strait by his Sides; when my Father, setting his left Foot on Nasgig's Neck, pronounced these Words: Lask, 
[Page 52]
I give thee Life, thou art a Filgay. Then Nasgig raising himself on his Knees, made Obeisance to my Father, and standing up stroaked his Chin; and my Father taking him by the Hand, in token of Equality, the Ceremony ceased. 
Now Son, says my Father, let me hear your Request? It is only, Sir, said I, Preferment for the deserving, equal to his Merit. My Father asked him if he understood the Duty of a Gorpel, [a sort of Ensign.] He did not reply yes, but beginning, gave a compendious sort of History of his whole Duty; at which, all the Colambs were very much surpris'd; for even his Comrades were not apprized, or ever imagined he knew more of Military Affairs than themselves. My Father then asked him, if he knew how to behave as a Cluff [Captain]; but he made as little Difficulty of that as the other, going thro' the several Parts of Duty in all the different Branches, in Peace and War, at Home and Abroad. Son, says my Father, it is a Mystery to me, you should have found out more in an Hour, than I myself could in half an Age; for this Man was born in my Palang [Town], of my own Lask, and has been mine, and my Father's, these forty Years. I shall be glad if you will look on the rest of my Lasks, and give me your Opinion; I may have more as deserving. I told him, such as Nasgig were not to be met with very often; and when 
[Page 53]
they were found, ought to be cherished accordingly. 
Sir, says I, Nature works upon the same sort of Materials divers ways; on some in sport, and some in earnest; and if the necessary Qualifications of a great Man are impressed on our Mass, 'tis odds but we improve regularly into one, tho' it may never be publickly known, or even to ourselves, till a proper Occasion: For as a curious Genius will be most inquisitive after, and is most an end retentive of Knowledge; so no Man is less ostentatious of it. He covets Knowledge, not from the Prospect of Gain, but meerly for its own sake; the very knowing, being his Recompence: And if I may presume to give you a Hint, how properly to bestow your Favours, let it be on Persons like this; for the vain knowing Man, who is always shewing it, as he for the most part labours for it, to shew out with, and procure his Rise by it, were it not for the Hopes of that, would not think Knowledge worth attaining; and as his Rise is his Aim, if he could invent any more expeditious Method than that, he would not pretermit any ill Act, that might advance him according to his Lust of rising. But the Man who aims at Perfection, from his natural Inclination, must, to attain his End, avoid all ill Courses, as Impediments to that Perfection he lusts after: And that, by Nasgig's Worth being so little known, I'll answer for 
[Page 54]
it, is his Character. And this being true, yourself will deduce the Consequence, which is the fitter Man to bear place; for with me it is a Maxim, He that labours after Truth for Truth's sake, and that he surely must who proposes no worldly View in it, can't arrive at his Ends by false Methods; but is always the truest Friend to himself and others, the trustiest Subject to his Lord, and the most faithful Servant to his God. 
My Father then turning to me, Son, says he, you have enlightened me more than ever I was before, and have put me on a new way of thinking; for which I am to return you many Thanks. And the whole Company doing the same, says my Father, I lost a brave General-Officer lately, who was destined to the Western Wars, which are breaking out; and have been long debating in my Mind, to whom I should commit his Corps; and, but for the Hazard of the Enterprize, I would have now given it to Nasgig; but shall be loth to lose him so soon, after I am acquainted with his Worth; so will think of some other Post nearer my Person for him, less dangerous, tho' perhaps, not so honourable. 
Great Sir, says Nasgig, I am too sensible of the Honour already done me, to think any Post wherein I may continue to serve you either too mean, or too hazardous for me: And as Valour 
[Page 55]
is no where so conspicuous, as in the greatest Dangers, I shall esteem my Blood spent to great Advantage in any Enterprize where my Duty under your Command leads me: I therefore the rather humbly request this dangerous Post, that I may either lose my Life in your Service, or live to see you justified in your Advancement of me, by the whole Nation. For what can I do, or how can I demonstrate my Affection to your Person and Pleasure, in an inactive State? 
Here the whole Level rang with Applause to Nasgig. 
My Father then giving his Hand to Nasgig, in token of Friendship, and his Word for Investiture in the Command of that vacant Post, the whole Level again resounded with Long live Pendlehamby, and his Servant Nasgig. 
This being the last Day of my Company's stay, for they had agreed to go homewards next Morning, some of them moved to return the sooner, that they might have time to hear out my Story. So that our stay was very little longer. 
In our return home Nasgig singled me out, to return his Acknowledgements for my Favour, and viewing my Gun, told me, they had no such thing growing in his Country. I told him, if he had it would do no good, without my Powder. I then at his Request described what I had heard of our Method of Fighting in Battle in 
[Page 56]
Europe; and mentioning our Cannon, he said, he supposed they killed every Man they hit. No, says I, not so bad as that; sometimes they hit the Flesh only, and that is commonly cured; sometimes break a Leg, or Arm, and that may in time be cured, some so well, as to be useful again, and others are cut off, and healed up again; but if the Ball hits the Head, or Vitals, it is commonly mortal. O, says he, give me the Head or Vitals then, no broken Limbs for me. 
After Dinner, at their Request, I went on with my Story, at repairing the Castle, and my Escape with Glaulepze, and so on to the Crocodile; when I repeated his Speech to me on that Account, and told them, it had made such an Impression upon me, that I had endeavoured to make it the leading Thought of my Mind, and had set it down upon one of my Doors at the Grotto, that it might the oftner be in my Sight, when any Difficulty arose. 
One of the Colambs begged Pardon for interrupting, but told me, tho' he understood what Glaulepze meant, he could not tell how I could set what he said down at my Grotto, or have it in my Sight; and desired me to explain that. I would have told my Guest I took it down in Writing, if that would not have puzzled the Cause more; but, to go the nearest way I could, I told him, we had a Method in my Country, of conveying to a Man at a great Distance whatever 
[Page 57]
we have a mind to say to him; and in such a manner, that no Body but himself would know, what we would have him know. And pausing here a little, to consider the easiest Method of demonstrating this to their Senses, they told me, they had gone as far as their Conjectures could carry them, but could conclude on nothing so probable as sending it by a Messenger. I told them, that in part was my way; but my Messenger should not know the Message he carried. That gravelled them quite, and they were unanimous, that was what could not be done. By this time I had sent for a Wood-coal, to write with upon my Deal-table; and kneeling down to the Table, I began to write, "" I then called them all to me: Now, says I, suppose I want to know how my Father gets back to Arndruumstake, my way is this, I set down so many Words as will express my Meaning to my Father, after the manner you see on this Table, and make a little Distance between each Word, which is the same thing as you do in speaking; for there, if you run one Word into another, and don't give each its proper Sound, who can understand you? For tho' you speak what contains all the Words, yet, without the proper Sound and Distinction, it is only Confusion. Do you understand that? They 
[Page 58]
told me they did. Then, says I, these are the Words I would have my Father know, I being at this Arkoe, and he at Arndruumstake. Honoured Sir, and so I read on; here, says I, you must take us to be Countrymen, and that he and I understand both the same Method. Now look, this Word, which ends where you see the Gap, stands for honoured, and this next for Sir, the next for I, and so on; and we both using the same Method, and seeing each others Words, are able to open our Minds at a Distance. -I was now in Hopes I had done, and was going on with my Story; but, says one of the Colambs, Mr. Peter, tho' this is a Matter that requires Consideration, I plainly see how you do it, by agreeing that all these Strokes, put into this Form, shall stand for the Word honoured, and so on, as you say, let who will make them; but have not you set down there the Word Arndruumstake? Yes, says I; why then, says he, none of your Countrymen could understand what that means. No? says I, smiling, but they could. Says he, you say, you agree what Strokes shall stand for one Word, and what for another; but then, how could your Countryman, who never knew what Strokes you would set down for Arndruumstake, know that your Strokes meant that very Country? For that you could not have agreed upon, before either of you knew there was any such Place. 

[Page 59]
I was at a loss, without spending more Words than I was willing about it, how to answer this close Reasoner; and talking of Syllables, and Letters, would only have perplexed the Affair more; so I told him the readiest for dispatch, that as every Word consisted of one or more distinct Sounds, and as some of the same Sounds happened in different Words, we did not agree so much upon making our Strokes stand for several Words, as for several Sounds; and those Sounds, more or less of them, added together, made the particular Words. As for Example, says I, Arn is one Sound, druum is another Sound, and stake is another; now, by our knowing how to set down these several Sounds by themselves, we can couple them, and apply them to the making up any Word, in the manner we please; and therefore he, by seeing those three Sounds together, knows I mean Arndruumstake, and can speak it as well, tho' he never heard the whole Word spoken together, as if he heard me speak to him. I have some little Notion of what you mean, says he, but not clear enough to express myself upon it; and so, go on, go on, and pray what did you do about the Reeds? 
I then resuming my Discourse where I left off, compleated my Narration that Night; but I could perceive the Water in my Father's Eyes, when I came to the Account of Youwarkee's Fall, and the Condition I took her up in. 

[Page 60]
When I had done, they adjusted the Order of their Flight, for avoiding Confusion, one to go so long before another, and the junior Colambs to go first. 
In the Morning nothing was to be heard but the Gripsacks; the Men were all ranged in Order to go off with their respective Colambs; and after all Compliments passed, the junior Colamb arising, walked half-way the Wood, where his Gripsack standing to wait for him, preceded him to the Level, the next Gripsack standing ready to sound as soon as the first removed; and this was the Signal for the second Colamb to move; so that each Colamb was a Quarter of a Mile before the other. 
My Father was the last but two; but I shall never forget his Tenderness, at parting with his Daughter and Grandchildren, and I may say with myself too; for by this time he had a high Opinion of me. Patty went with my Father, she so much resembling my Wife, that my Father said, he should still have his two Daughters in his Sight, having her with him. 
At parting, I presented Nasgig with a broad Sword, and shewing him the Use of it, with many Expressions of Gratitude on his Part, and Respect on mine, he took flight after the rest. 

[Page 61]

CHAP. VII. 

Peter finds his Stores low; sends Youwarkee to the Ship; receives an Invitation to Georigetti's Court. 
For the first few Days after our Company had left us, Youwarkee could not forbear a Tear now and then for the Loss of her Father and Sister; but I endeavoured nor to see it, lest I should, by persuading her to the contrary, seem to oppose what I really thought was a further Token of the Sweetness of her Disposition; but it wore off by degrees, and having a clear Stage again, it cost us several Days to settle ourselves, and put our confused Affairs in Order; and when we had done, we blessed ourselves that we could come and go, and converse with the pleasing Tenderness we had hitherto always done. 
She told me, nothing in the World but her Concern for so tender a Father, and the Fear of displeasing me if she disobliged him, should have kept her so long from me; for her Life had never been so sweet and serene as with me and her Children; and if she was to begin it again, and chuse her Settlement and Company, it should be with me in that Arkoe. I told her, tho' I was intirely of her Opinion for avoiding a Life of Hurry, yet I loved a little Company, if for 
[Page 62]
nothing else but to advance Topicks for Discourse, to the Exercise of our Faculties; but I then agreed, it was not from meer Judgment I spoke, but from Fancy. But Youwee, says I, it will be proper for us to see what our Friends have left us, that we don't want before the time comes about again: Then she took her part, and I mine; and having finished, we found they would hold out pretty well, and that the first thing to be done, was to get the Oil of the Beast-Fish. 
When we came to examine the Brandy and Wine, I found they had suffered greatly; so I told Youwarkee, when she could spare time, she should make another Flight to the Ship; and, says I, pray look at all the small Casks of Wine or Brandy, or be they what they will, if they are not above half full, or thereabouts, they will swim, and you may send them down. I desired her to send a Fire-shovel, and Tongs, describing them to her; and there are abundance of good Ropes between Decks, rolled up, send them, says I, and any thing else you think we shall want, as Plates, Bowls, and all the Cutlasses and Pistols, says I, that hang in the Room by the Cabin: For I would, methinks, have another Cargoe, as it may possibly be the last; for the Ship can't hold for ever. 
Youwarkee, who loved a Jaunt to the Ship mightily, sat very attentive to what I said, and 
[Page 63]
told me, if I pleas'd, she would go the next Day; to which I agreed. 
She stayed on this Trip till I began to be uneasy for her, being gone almost four Days, and I was in great Fear of some Accident; but she arrived safe, telling me, she had sent all she could any ways pack up; and any one who had seen the Arrival of her Fleet would have taken it for a good Ship's Cargoe, for it cost me full three Weeks to land and draw them up to the Grotto; and then we had such a Redundancy of things, that we were forced to pile them upon each other, to the Top of the Room. 
It began to draw towards long Days again, when one Morning in Bed I heard the Gripsack. I waked Youwarkee, and told her of it; and we both got up, and were going to the Level, when we met six Glumms in the Wood, with a Gripsack before them, coming to the Grotto. The Trumpeter, it seems, had been there before; but the others, who seemed to be of a better Rank, had not. We saluted them, and they us; and Youwarkee knowing one of them, we desired them to walk to the Grotto. 
They told us, they came Express from Georigetti's Palace, with an Invitation to me and Youwarkee to spend some time at his Court. I let them know, what a Misfortune I lay under in not being born with the Graundee, since 
[Page 64]
Providence had pleased to dispose of me in a Part of the World where alone it could have been of such infinite Service to me; or I should have taken it for the highest Honour, to have laid myself at their Master's Feet: And after some other Discourse, one of them pressed me to return his Master my Answer; for they had but a very little time to stay. I told them, they saw plainly, by bareing my Breast to them, that I was under an absolute Incapacity for such a Journey, and gratifying the highest Ambition I could have in the World; for I was pinned down to my Arkoe, never more to pass the Barrier of that Rock. One of them then asking, if I should chuse to go, if it was possible to convey me thither; I told him, he could scarce have the least Doubt, was my Ability to perform such a Journey equal to my Inclination to take it, that I should in the least hesitate at obeying his Master. Sir, says he, you make me very happy, in the Regard you shew my Master; and I must beg Leave to stay another Day with you. I told him, they did me great Honour; but little thought what it all tended to. 
We were very facetious; and they talked of the number of Visitors I had here; and they mentioned several Facts which had happened, and amongst the rest that of Nasgig, who they said, since his Return, had been introduced by 
[Page 65]
Pendlehamby to the King, and was for his great Prudence and Penetration become Georigetti's great Favourite. They told me, War was upon the Point of breaking out, and several other Pieces of News, which, as they did not concern me, I was very easy about. 
The next Morning they desiring to walk, and view what was most remarkable in my Arkoe, and above all to see my fire my Gun, which they had heard so much of; I gratified them at a Mark, and hit the Edge of it, and found them quite staunch, without the least Start at the Report. I paid them a Compliment upon it, and told them how their Countrymen had behaved, even at a second firing: But, says he who was the chief Spokesman, and knew I found as much as I could tell him, that second Fright was from seeing Death the Consequence of the first; and tho' you had then to do mostly with Soldiers, you must not think they chuse Death more than others, tho' their Duty obliges them to shun it less. 
The same Person then desired me to shew him how to fire the Gun; which I did, and believe he might hit the Rock some where or other; but he did not seem to admire the Sport, and I having but few Balls left, did not recommend the Gun to the rest. 
A little before Bed-time, the Strangers told me, they believed I should see Nasgig next 
[Page 66]
Morning. I presently thought there was somewhat more than ordinary in this Visit; but could no ways dive to the Bottom of it. 
Just before they went to Rest, they ordered the Trumpeter to be early on the Rock next Morning; and, upon the first Sight of Nasgig's Corps, to sound Notice of it, for us to be ready to receive him. 

[Page 67]

CHAP. VIII. 

Nasgig comes with a Guard to fetch Peter; long Debate about his going; Nasgig's Uneasiness at Peter's Refusal; relates a Prediction to him, and Proceedings thereon at Georigetti's Court; Peter consents to go; prepares a Machine for that Purpose. 
We were waked by the Trumpet, giving Notice of Nasgig's coming; I did not care to enquire of the Stranger into the Particulars of his Embassy; for be it what it will, thinks I, Nasgig is so much my Friend, that I can know the Motives of it from him, and, or I am much deceived, he is too honest to impose upon me: But I had but little time for Thought, for upon our entring the Level, we found him and his Train, of at least an hundred Persons, just alighting before us. 
We embraced, and professed the particular Pleasure Fortune had done us, in once more meeting together. When we arrived at the Grotto, he told me, he was assured I had been informed of the Occasion of his Visit; and that it would be the greatest Honour done to his Country, that could be imagined. He then laid his Hand on my Beard, which was now of about five Months Growth, having never shaved it since 
[Page 68]
my Father went, and told me, he was glad to see that. And are you not so to see me, says I? Yes surely, says he, for I prize that for your sake. But, says I, pray be open with me and tell me, what you mean by my being informed of the Occasion of your coming? Why, says he, of Georigetti's Message to you; as it will be of such infinite Service to our Country: And, says he, if you had not consented to it, the Messengers had returned and stopped me. True, says I, one of the Messengers told me the King would be glad to see me; which as I, so well as he, knew it was impossible he should; in return to his Compliment, I believe I might say, what a Happiness it would be to me if I could wait on him. But pray what is your immediate Message, for I hear you are in great Favour at Court, and would never have come hither with this Retinue in so much Ceremony, on a trifling Account. 
My dear Peter, says Nasgig, know that your Fame has reached far and near since I saw you before; and our State tho' a large and populous one, and once of mighty Power and twice its present Extent, by the Revolt of the western Part of it who chose themselves a King, has been so miserably harrassed by Wars, that the Revolters, who are ever fomenting Discontent and Rebellion amongst us, will, by the Encroachments they daily make on us, certainly reduce us at last to a Province under their Government; which will render 
[Page 69]
us all Slaves to an usurped Power, set up against our lawful Sovereign. Now, these things were foretold long enough before they actually began to be transacted; but all being then at Peace, and no Prospect of what has since happened, we looked not out for a Remedy, till the Disease became stubborn and incurable. Pray, says I, by whom were the things you mention foretold? By a very ancient and grave Ragam, says he. How long ago, says I? O, above four times the Age of the oldest Man living, says he. And when did he say it would happen, says I? That, says he, was not quite so clear then. But how do you know, says I, that he ever said any such thing? Why the thing itself was so peculiar, says he, and the Ragam delivered it so positively, that his Successors have ever since pronounced it twelve times a Year publickly Word for Word, to put the People in mind of it, and from whom they must hope for Relief; and now the long expected time being come, we have no hopes but in your Destruction of the Tyrant-Usurper. I destroy him, says I! if he is not destroyed till I do it, I fear your State is but in a bad Case. My good Friend Peter, says he, you or no body can do it. Pugh, says I, Nasgig, I took you for a Man of more Sense, notwithstanding the Prejudices of Education, than to think, because you have seen me kill a Beast-Fish, that could not come to hurt me, at the Distance of twenty Paces; that I can 
[Page 70]
kill your Usurper, at the Distance he is from me. No, my good Friend, says Nasgig, I know you take me to have more Judgment than to think so. Why, what else can I do, says I? unless he will come hither to be killed by me. Dear Peter, says he, you will not hear me out. I will, says I, say on. You, as I said before, being the only Person that can, according to our Prediction, destroy this Usurper, and restore Peace among us; my Master Georigetti, and the whole State of Norrunbdsgrsutt, were going to send a splendid Embassy to you; but your Father advising to repose the Commission wholly in me, they all consented to it, and I am come to invite you over to Brandleguarp for that Purpose. I know you will tell me you have not the Graundee, and can't get thither: But I am assured you have what is far better; the Wisdom you have will help you to surmount that Difficulty, which our whole Moucherat can't get over. And I am sure did you apply half the Thought to accomplish it, you seem to do to invent Excuses against it, you would easily overcome that. And now, dear Friend, continues he, refuse me not; for as my first Rise was owing to your Favour, so my Downfal as absolutely attends your Refusal. 
Dear Nasgig, says I, you know I love you, and could refuse you nothing in my Power; but for me to be mounted in the Air, I know not how, over these Rocks, and then drowned by a 
[Page 71]
Fall into the Sea, which is a necessary Consequence of such a mad Attempt; and all this, in Prosecution of a Project founded upon an old Wife's Tale, is such a Chimera, as all Men of Sense would laugh at; as if there was no way of destroying me, but with a Guard of an hundred Men, to souse me into the wide Ocean. A very pretty Conqueror of Rebels I should prove truly, kicking for Life, till the next Wave sent me to the Bottom. 
Nasgig looked then so grave, I almost thought I should have heard no more of it; but after a short Pause, Peter, says he, I am sorry you make so light of sacred things; a thing foretold so long ago by a holy Ragam, kept up by undoubted Tradition ever since in the manner I have told you, in part performed, and now waiting your Concurrence for its Accomplishment; but if I can't prevail with you, tho' I perish at my Return, I dread to think you may be forced without Thanks to perform, what generously to undertake will be your greatest Glory. 
Pray, says I, Nasgig, for now I perceive you are in earnest, what may this famous Prediction be? 
Ah, Peter, says Nasgig, to what Purpose should I relate so sacred a Prediction to one who, tho' the most concerned in it, makes such a Jest of it? 

[Page 72]
His mentioning me as concerned in it, raised my Curiosity once more to desire a Relation of it. Why should I relate it, says he, if you are resolved not to fulfil it? I told him, I had no Resolution against any thing that related to my own good, or that of my Friends; but the greatest Question with me, says I, is, whether I am at all concerned in it. O, clearly, clearly, says he, there is no doubt of it, it must mean you or no body. I told him I must judge by the Words of it, that I was the Person intended by it; and till that was apparent to my Reason, it would be difficult to procure my Consent to so perilous an Undertaking. And, says he, will you upon hearing it judge impartially, and go with me if you can take the Application to yourself? I can't go quite so far as that, says I, but this I'll promise you, I'll judge impartially, and if I can so apply it to myself, that it must necessarily mean me and no other, and if you can convince me I may go safely, I will go. 
Nasgig was so rejoiced at this, he was at a loss how to express himself. My dear Peter, says he, you have given me new Life; our State is free, our Persons free, we're free, we're free; and Peter, says he, now I have given Vent to my Joy, you shall hear the Prediction. 
You must know, this holy Ragam lived four Ages ago; and from certain Dreams and Revelations he had had, set himself to overturn our 
[Page 73]
Country-Worship of the great Image; and by his Sanctity of Life and sound Reasonings, had almost effected it under the Assistance of Begsurbeck then our King, who had fully embraced his Tenets; but the rest of the Ragams opposing him, and finding he could not advance his Scheme, he withdrew from the Ragams, to a close Retirement for several Years; and just before his Death, sending for the King and all the Ragams, he told them, he should certainly die that Day; and that he could not die at Peace, till he had informed them what had been revealed to him; desiring them to take Notice of it, not as a Conjecture of his own, but a certain Verity which should hereafter come to pass. Says he, "" The Ragam having said this, expired. 
This Prediction made so great an Impression on Begsurbeck, that he ordered all the Ragams singly before him, and heard them repeat it; which having done, and made himself perfect in it, he ordered it to be pronounced twelve times in the Year, on particular Days, in the Moucherat, that the People might learn it by heart; that they and their Children being perfect in it, might not fail of applying it, when the Man from the Waters should appear with proper Description. 
Thus Peter, says he, has this Prediction been kept up in our Memories as perfectly, as if it had but just been pronounced to us. 
Tis very true, says I, here may have been a Prediction, and it may have been as you say, handed down very exactly from Begsurbeck's Days till now; but, how does that affect me? how am I concerned in it? Surely, if any Marks 
[Page 75]
would have denoted me to be the Man; some of the Colambs, who have so lately left me, and were so long with me, would have found them out in my Person, or among the several Actions of my Life I recounted to them. 
Upon the Return of the Colambs from you, says Nasgig, they told his Majesty what they had heard and seen at Grandevolet; and the Story was conveyed thro' the whole Realm; but every Man has not the Faculty of Distinction: Now, one of the Ragams when he had heard of you, applying you to the Prediction, and that to you, soon found our Deliverer in you; and, at a public Moucheratt, after first pronouncing the Prediction, declared himself thereon to the following Effect: 
""Our Prediction foretells the past Evils, their Increase and Continuance, till the Waters of the Earth shall produce a Glumm: Here I must appeal to the honourable Colambs present, if the Waters have not done so, in the Person of Glumm Peter of Grandevolet; as they have received it from his own Report.""The next part says the Ragam, is, he is to be hairy round his Head; and how his Person in this respect agrees with the Prediction, I beg leave to be informed by the Colambs.""Then let this, says he, be put to the Trial, by an Embassy to Glumm Peter; and if it answers, there will be no Room to doubt the rest. Then, says the Ragam, it is plain by the Report of the Colambs, that Glumm Peter has not the Graundee. 
"" To which, the Colambs all agreed. ""Now, says he, let us see the Benefit predicted to us, upon the Arrival of Glumm Peter. Our Words are; who, with unknown Fire and Smoak, shall destroy the Traitor of the West. What can be plainer 
[Page 78]
than this? For I again appeal to the Colambs, for his making unknown Fire and Smoak. 
""I hope, says the Ragam, I have given Satisfaction in what I have said, and shall now leave it to the Care of those, whose Business it is to provide, that none of those Woes pronounced against us may happen; by missing the time, which when gone, will never return.""Mighty King, and you honourable Lords his Colambs, here is present the Glumm Peter of Grandevolet; I wait your Commands, where to dispose him.""Mighty King, you reverend Ragams, and honourable Colambs, with the good People of this august Assembly: I am come hither, led by the Force of your own Prediction, at the Request of his Majesty and the States, at the Peril of my Life, to accomplish things said to be predicted of me Glumm Peter. If then you have a Prediction; if then your Prediction describes me, and the Circumstances of these times; it consisting of several parts, they ought seriously to be weighed, that I may know when and where I am to begin my Operation; and when and where to leave off: For in Predictions, the whole is to be accomplished as much as any Member of it. 
"" Then every one answered yea. "" Here the King rose up; but Barbarsa giving him a Touch, for every one waited to be guided by the Voice of the Ragams; he sat down again, and no one answering yea. I again put the same Question and told them, as it was their own Concern, I 
[Page 131]
would have an Answer before I proceeded. One of the Ragams then rose and said, that part of the Prediction was too loose to be relied on; for it was to settle what he would have taught: Now who knows, says he, what he would have taught? The Assembly paused a considerable time; and just as I was opening my Mouth to speak, an ancient and venerable Ragam rose; says he, I am sorry at my Years to find the Truth wants an Advocate; my Age and Infirmities might well have excused me from speaking in this Assembly; so many of my Brethren being present, younger and better qualified for that Purpose than myself; but, as we are upon a sacred thing, and least, as I find none of them care to declare the Truth, I should also be thought to consent to its Suppression, if I sat silent and suffered it to be hid under a Quibble: I must beg to be heard a few Words. My Brother who spoke last says, the Words are too loose, which say, and by common Consent establish what I would have taught; but, I beg leave to think it far otherwise; for we all know what he would have taught, and the Memory of that hath been as exactly kept as the Prediction: For how could our Ancestors have opposed his Doctrine, but from hearing and disapproving it; And we all know, not only the Prediction, but the Doctrine hath been punctually handed down to us; tho' wo be to us, we have not proclaimed it as we have the Prediction; and 
[Page 132]
let me tell you, when you my Brethren severally come to my Years, and have but a single Step further to Hoximo, you will wish you had taught it, as I do; who do believe and approve it. 
The poor old Man having spoke as long as his Breath and Spirits would permit him, sat down; and I again resumed the Question, as I now thought on a much better Foundation than before, and was immediately told by another Ragam, that there would be no End of the Assembly, if we considered every Point at once; for we might next go upon what Countries we should conquer, and of whom to demand Tribute; which would be debating about the Fruit, before the Seed was sown. But his Opinion was, to go on and quell the Rebellion, and restore the Monarchy, and then go upon the other Points. 
I told them, if they made so light of the Prediction, as not to declare publickly, since they knew it, what the Ragam would have taught; it ill became me, to be more zealous in their own Concerns than they were themselves; and I should imagine there was very little Truth in any part of it, and would never hazard my Life for their sakes, who would not speak the Truth to save the Kingdom; and desired Leave of the States for my Departure; for I was not a Person I told them, to be cajoled into any thing. I undertook it at first voluntarily; and no Man could, or should compel me to it; my Life they might 
[Page 133]
take, but my Honour they should never stain; tho' I was assured I could easily with their Concurrence, compleat all that related to them. 
The senior Colamb immediately rising, desired me to have a little Patience, and not to leave the Assembly, for I was going out, till I had heard him. 
Here is, says he, this Day a thing started, which I think, every whit as much concerns us all, and the Body, and every Member of the People to know, as it does Peter; and I am surprized, unless the present Ragams believe what their Predecessor would have taught to be better than what they now teach, for nothing else can make us consent to it, that they should scruple to let us know it, and keep us ignorant, who are Worshippers as well as themselves, of any Matter which so nearly concerns us to know. I am for obliging the Ragams to declare the Truth. If this be a true Prediction, all the Relatives to it are true; and I insist that we hear it. 
This Speech imboldened several others, and all the Populace, siding with the Colombs out of Curiosity, cryed out to know it. 
Perceiving the Ragams still hush, I rose and beckoning the Populace to silence: "" Some of the Ragams cried Yes. "" Again, Yes to be sure. "" whipping out my Cutlass, and with the Backside of it striking its Head off. ""You greatly mistake me, O Glumms, says I, if you imagine I would have all those reverend Men turned out of Imployment as useless. No, I find they know too much of what is valuable; and therefore those who are willing to continue in the Service of the Mouch, and faithfully to teach you the old Ragam's Doctrine, and such further Lights of the great Being as they shall hereafter receive, let them continue your Ragams still; and let others be chosen, and trained up in that Doctrine.""Reverend, says I, you see your Prediction this Day about to be fulfilled; for if it is a true one, no Force of Man can withstand it. You see your Image disgraced; you see, and I appeal to you all for the Truth of it, that what the Ragam would have taught has, without your Assistance been disclosed. I therefore would have you the first to break the Bondage of Idolatry, and turn to the true Collwarr; as it will be so much Glory to you. Will you, and which of you, from henceforth serve Collwarr, and no longer worship an Idol? Such of you as will do so, let them continue in the Mouch: If none of you will, it shall be my Business to qualify a sufficient Number of true Ragams, to form a Succession for that Purpose. The Issue of this great Affair, depends upon your Answers.""Great Sir, says I, it is my peculiar Happiness, to be appointed by Providence as the Proposer of a Marriage for the Princess Stygee your Daughter, with a potent neighbouring Monarch; having already been enabled to perform things past belief for his Honour. Know then, great Sir, I am a Native of the North, and thro' infinite Perils and Hardships, at last arrived in the Dominions of Georigetti, where I have given Peace to his State, by the Death of the Usurper Harlokin. I have just also conquered the Kingdom of Mount Alkoe for my Master, and am here come to make your Daughter an Offer of both Crowns, and also of all that is my Master's, with his Person in Marriage.""May it please your Majesty, we are almost right; but what has always staggered me is, how the Person should come; for the Messenger to us on this Errand, is to come from above. Now this Person has not the Graundee, and therefore could not come from thence: As for the rest, I understand the Prince, from whom he brings this Offer to your Daughter, has the Graundee; and so is a Male of her own kind: And I understand the two Kingdoms in his Possession, to be the two Crowns in the Messenger's Hands; but I say, what I stick at is, his coming from above." 

[Page 265]
What, says Stygee, did not you see him come? No, says he; O, says she, he came in the Air, and was a long time over the City, before he descended. That's impossible, says the old Priest, for he is smooth like us. Indeed Sir, says she, I saw him, and so did most of the Court. The King and Nobles, then attesting this Truth; Sir, says the Priest to the King, it is compleated, and your Majesty must do the rest. 
I little expected, says the King, to see this Day; and now, Daughter, as this Message was designed for you, you only can answer it; but still I must say, it surpasses my Comprehension, that in the Decree of Providence, it should be so ordered, that the very Hand which brings the Accomplishment of what has been so long since foretold us, should, without Design, have first destroyed all that could have rendered the Marriage State uncomfortable to you. 
Stygee then declared, she submitted to Fate, and her Father's Will. 
I stayed here a Week, to view the Country and the Sea, which I heard was not far off. Here were many useful Beasts, for Food and Burthen, Fowles also in Plenty, and Fish near the Sea Coasts, and the People eat Flesh; so that I thought myself amongst Mankind again. I made all the Remarks the shortness of the time would allow, and then taking my Leave, departed. 

[Page 266]
I returned to the Colony, where I heard that the Little-landers had been on the Coast; but I not being there, or any Lading ready, they were gone away again. However, they had detained two of them. I was pleased with that, but sorry they were returned empty. 
I examined the Prisoners, and by giving them Liberty and good Usage, they settled amongst us; and the next Fleet that came, the Sailors to a Man were all my own, the Moment they could get to Shoar; this, tho' I thought it would have spoilt our Trade at first, brought the Islanders and me to the following Compromise, and upon this Occasion. Their Ships, having lain on our Coasts one whole Season, for want of Hands to carry them back; I came to an Agreement with their Commanders, for they were all willing to return, that such a Number of them, should be left as Hostages with me, till the Return of a Number of my own Men, which I should lend them to navigate their Ships home; and I sent word to the Zaps, that as it might be beneficial to us both, to keep the Trade still on foot; to prevent the like Inconveniencies for the future, I would buy their Shipping, paying for them in Metals; and agree to furnish them yearly, with such a Quantity of my Goods, at a stated Price; and would send them by my own People; which they approving, the Trade went on in a very 
[Page 267]
agreeable and profitable Manner; and we in time, built several new Vessels of our own, and imployed abundance of Hands in the Trade, and had Plenty of Handicrafts-men of different Occupations, each of whom I obliged to keep three Natives under him, to be trained up in his Business.

CHAP. XXI. 

A Discourse on Marriage between Peter and Georigetti; Peter proposed Stygee; the King accepts it; relates his Transactions at Norbon; the Marriage is consummated; Account of the Marriage Ceremony; Peter goes to Norbon; opens a free Trade to Mount Alkoe; gets Traders to settle at Norbon; convoys Cattle to Mount Alkoe. 
At my Return to Sass Doorpt Swangeanti, I went directly to the King, and giving him an Account of the Settlement, and my Proceedings thereon; he told me, his whole Kingdom would not be an Equivalent for the Services I had done him. I begged of him, to look on them in no other a light, than as flowing from my Duty; but, if when I should be no more, he or his Children would be gracious to my Family, it was all I desired. 
This Father, says the King, I can undertake for myself; but who's to come after me, no body knows; for I shall never marry, no, Yaccombourse has given me a Surfeit of Woman-kind; and unless the States will settle the Kingdom on you, to which I will consent, it will probably be torn to pieces again, by different Competitors; for I am the last of the Line of Begsurbeck, and of all 
[Page 269]
the Blood Royal: And indeed, who so proper to maintain it flourishing, as he who has brought it to the present Perfection. 
Great Sir, says I, my Ambition rises no higher, than to abound in good Deeds whilst I live, and to perfect my Children in the same Principle; and this, I hope, will intitle them to a Support, when I am gone: But, says I, why is your Majesty so averse from Marriage, merely on account of a Woman you could not expect to be true to you? Not expect it, says he? what stronger Tie upon Earth could she have had to be true, than my Affection, and all that my Kingdom could afford her? Weak things all, Sir, says I. Why, what could she have had, says he, in some Warmth? Honour, Sir, says I, and Virtue, both which she abandoned to become yours; and those once lost, how could you expect her to be true? You are too hard for me, Father, says he; but they are all alike, and I don't believe there's a Grain of Honour in any of them. In any of them like Yaccombourse, I admit Sir, says I, but think not so of others; for no part of our Species abounds more with it, or is more tender of it, than a good Woman; and take my word for it, Sir, there is more real Sincerity in an ordinary Wife, than in the most extraordinary Mistress. We are all biassed naturally by Interest; and as there can be but one real Interest between the Man and Wife, so the 
[Page 270]
Interest of a Mistress is, and ever will be, only to accommodate herself; for its all one to her with whom she engages, so she can raise but the Market by a Change: Now, if your Majesty could find an agreeable and virtuous Wife, one deserving of your Royal Person and Bed, and perhaps with a Kingdom for her Dowry; a Partner fit to share your Cares, as well as Glory; would it not be a great Pleasure to you, to be possessed of such a Mate? And to see Heirs arising under your Joint-Tuition, to convey down your Royal Blood to the latest Posterity? Would not this I say, be a grateful Reflection to you, in your declining Years? 
Truly Father, says the King, as you have painted it, the Prospect could not fail to please; and under the Circumstances you have put it, it would meet my Approbation; but where is such a thing, as a Woman of this Character to be found? I fear only in the Imagination. 
Sir, says I, after a seeming Muse for some time, what should you think of Oniwheske, the King of Norbon's Daughter; he has but that one Child I hear? Dear Father have done, says his Majesty; to what Purpose should you mention her? We but barely know there is such a State, we have never had an Intercourse; and besides, as you say he has but one Child, can you suppose she will ever marry, to leave so fine a Kingdom, and 
[Page 271]
live here? But Sir, says I, now we are supposing, suppose she should, with her Father's Consent, be willing to marry you; would you have her for your Queen? To make any doubt of that Father, says he, is almost to suppose me a Fool. Then Sir, says I, her Father has consented, and she too; and if I durst have presumed so far, or had known your Mind sooner, she would, I believe, have ventured with me, to have become yours; but you might have slighted her, and crown'd Heads are not to be trifled with; but since you are pleased to shew your Approbation of it, I can assure you, Sir, her Person will yield to none in your Majesty's Dominions: For Sir, I have been there, and have seen her, and she is your own, and her Kingdom too, upon Demand. 
Father, says the King, looking earnestly at me; I have been frequently, since I knew you first, in doubt of my own Existence; my Life seems a Dream to me; for if Existence is to be judged of by one's Faculties only, I have been in such a Delusion of them ever since, that as I find myself unable to judge with Certainty of any other thing, so I am subject to doubt, whether I really exist. Are these things possible that you tell me, Father? 
I then told him the whole Affair, and advised him by all means to accept the Offer, and marry the Princess out of Hand. 

[Page 272]
His Majesty, when I had brought him thoroughly to believe me, was as eager to consummate the Marriage, as I was to have him: But then, whether he should go to her, or she come to him was the Question. I told him, it was a thing unusual, for a Sovereign to quit his own Dominions for a Wife; but would advise an Embassy to her Father, with Notice, that his Majesty would meet and espouse her, on the Frontiers of the two Kingdoms. 
The Embassadors returning, with an Appointment of time and place; it was not above a Month, before I had settled Stygee on the Thrones of Sass Doorpt Swangeanti and Mount Alkoe, with the Reversion of the Kingdom of Norbon, without a Competitor. 
I shall here give you an Account of the Marriage Ceremony. The King being arrived on the Borders; Stygee, who had waited but a few Hours at the last Village in Norbon, advanced to his Majesty on the very Division, as they called it, of the two Kingdoms; a Line being drawn, to express the Bounds of each. The King and Stygee, having talked apart from the Company a little Space, each standing Hand in Hand, on their own respective Ground: The chief Ragam advanced, and began the Ceremony. 
He first asked each Party aloud, if he and she were willing to be united in Body and Affections, and would engage to continue so their whole 
[Page 273]
Lives; to which, each Party having answered aloud in the Affirmative; shew me then a Token, says he; and immediately each expanding the right Side of their Graundees, laid it upon the other's left Side, so that they appeared then but as one Body, standing Hand in Hand, incased round with the Graundee. The Ragam then having discanted upon the Duties of Marriage, concluded the Ceremony, with wishing them as Fruitful as Perigene and Philella. So soon as it was over, and the Gripsacks and Voices had finished an Epithalamium, the Bride and Bridegroom taking Wing, were conducted to Brandleguarp, amidst the Acclamations of an infinite Number of Georigetti's Subjects. 
The King had made vast Preparations for the Reception of the Princess Stygee, and nothing was to be heard or seen but Feastings and Rejoicing for many Days; and his Majesty afterwards assured me, of his intire Satisfaction in my Choice of his Bride; without whom he confessed, that notwithstanding the many other Blessings I had procured him, his Happiness must have been incompleat. 
Intending another Flight to Norbon, I was charged with the King and Queen's Compliments to Oniwheske; which having executed, I opened a free Trade to Mount Alkoe; and hearing that small Vessels came frequently on the Norbonese Coast to carry off the Iron, and other Metal 
[Page 274]
from thence unwrought; and paid part of their Return in wrought Metals: I ordered some of the next that came, to be stopped, and brought to me; and the Day before I had fixed for my Departure, Notice was sent, that twelve of those Traders were stopped, and in Custody at the Sea-side; I longed to see them, but then considering that it would take up more time to bring them to Apsilo the Capital, where I was, than I should take in going to them, and returning; I resolved to go and examine them myself. 
They told me, they traded with small Vessels to Norbon for Metals; which they carried home, and wrought great part of it themselves, sending it to, and dispersing it in several Islands at a Distance; and also sold the unwrought to several People, who carried it they knew not whither, in great Ships. They said, they kept abundance of Hands at work in the Trade. I asked if their Artificers wrought it for their own Profit, or their Masters. They told me for Masters, themselves being all Slaves. And are you all Slaves, says I? They told me yes, all but one, pointing to him. I then ordered him to be secured and removed; and told them, if they would procure some Hands to settle at Norbon and Mount Alkoe, they should all be made free, have Lands assigned them, and have other great Privileges; and I did not doubt in time, would become the richest Men in the Country; for I understood by them, 
[Page 275]
they were acquainted with the Use of Money. I asked them, what other Commodities they brought to Norbon in Exchange. They said, Cloaths for the People, both what they received in Exchange from others who brought their Iron, and some of a coarser sort of their own making. I found in my Discourse I had with them, that out of my eleven Men, there were Persons of four different Occupations; so I promised those who would stay with me, their Freedoms, good Houses, and other Rewards; and sending three Hands home with the Vessel, and a full Freight, according to the Value of the Cargoe they brought; I ordered them to engage as many as they could of their Countrymen of distinct Trades, to come and settle with me; and to be sure if they had any Grain, Corn, Roots, Plants, or Seeds, usually eaten for Food, to bring all they could get with them, and they should have good Returns for them; and as to those good Hands that settled here, they should be allowed all Materials, to work for their own Profit the first Year; and after that, they should also work for themselves, allowing the King one tenth of the clear Profit. -This took so far with them, that it was with the utmost Difficulty I got any of them to carry the Ship back, for fear they should not be able to return. 
Before I parted from them, I assigned the eight who were left, all proper Conveniencies, 
[Page 276]
and recommended them to the King's Protection; and I ordered the Owner then in Custody, to be conducted to Mount Alkoe, and from thence to Brandleguarp; where treating him kindly, and giving him Liberty, I made my proper use of him. 
The King having lent me a Convoy to conduct my Prisoner, and given me a Licence for as many Cattle of the sorts I chose, as I pleased to drive to Georigetti's Dominions; I made them drive a great Number of Sheep, of the finest Wool I ever saw, and very large also; a great Number of Creatures not unlike an Ass for Shape, but with two upright Horns and short Ears, which gave abundance of rich Milk; and also some Swine. All these were drove to, and distributed at my new Colony; where I let them remain, till I had provided a proper Receptacle for them at Doorpt Swangeanti, near the Woods; when I brought many over the black Mountain, and distributed there, with Directions how to manage them; and in about seven Years time, we held a little Beast Market near Brandleguarp, twice a Year, where the spare Cattle were brought up, and preserved in Salt till the next Market; for I had some Years before, made large Salt Works near the Sea, at Mount Alkoe; which imployed abundance of Hands, and was now become a considerable Trade. 

[Page 277]
We had Iron, Copper, and Silver Money, which went very current; and had Butter and Cheese from the Farms near the Woods, as plenty as we had the Fruits before; great Numbers of Families having settled there; and there was scarce a Family but was of some Occupation or other. 
By the Accounts I received from the Mines, from time to time, it was prodigious to hear, what vast Quantities of Metals were prepared in one Year now, by little above one third of the Hands that were usually imployed in them before; for now the Mens Ambition was, to leave a good Week's Work done at their return, for an Example to those who were coming; and the Overseers told me, they would sing and work, with the greatest Delight imaginable, whilst they pleased themselves with telling one another, how they intended to spend the next fourteen Days. 

[Page 278]

CHAP. XXII. 

Peter looking over his Books finds a Latin Bible; sets about a Translation; teaches some of the Ragams Letters; sets up a Paper Manufacture; makes the Ragams read the Bible; the Ragams teach others to read and write; a Fair kept at the black Mountain; Peter's Reflection on the Swangeantines. 
All things being now so settled, that they would go on of themselves; and having no further direct View in my Head, I spent some time with my Wife; and looking over my Books one Day to divert myself, with the greatest Joy imaginable, I found that the Bible I had taken to be in the Portuguese Tongue, was a Latin one. It was many Years since I had thought of that Language, but on this Occasion, by Force of Memory and Recollection, and with some Attention, Consideration, and Practice, I found it return to me in so plentiful a manner, that I fully resolved to translate my Bible into the Swangeantine Tongue. 
I sent directly for Lasmeel to be my Amanuensis; and to work we went upon the Translation. 
We began at the Creation, and descending to the Flood, went on to the Jewish Captivity in 
[Page 279]
Egypt, and Deliverence by Moses; leaving out the Genealogies, and all the Jewish Ceremonies and Laws, except the ten Commandments. I translated the Books of Samuel and Kings, down to the Babilonish Captivity. I then translated such parts of the Prophets, as were necessary to introduce the Messiah, and discover him; the Book of Psalms, Job, and the Proverbs, and with the utmost Impatience hasted to the New Testament. But then considering that when I had done, as only Lasmeel and myself could read it, in case of our Deaths, the Translation must die with us; I chose out six of the junior Ragams, and two of the elder, to learn Letters; and in less than twelve Months, I had brought them all to read mine and Lasmeel's Writing perfectly well. 
I instructed these Ragams at spare Hours, whilst I went on with my Translation, but finding my Paper grow low, having had a great Supply of coursish Linnen, and a sort of Callicoes from the Isles, in return for our Metals; I set up a Manufactory from that, and some Gums of the Trees, which we boiled with it to a Pulp in Iron Pans, and beating it to pieces, made a useful Paper, which would bear Ink tolerably. But I could find nothing to make Ink of, tho' I sent over all the Country, to search for every Herb and Fruit not commonly used; till at last I 
[Page 280]
found an Herb and Flower on it, which if taken before the Flower faded, would by boiling thoroughly become blew; this, by still more boiling in a Copper Pan, till it was dry and burnt hard to the Bottom, in some measure answered my Purpose, and I fixed upon it, as the best I could obtain from all my Experiments. 
When the Ragams were Masters of their Pens, I set six of them to copy what Lasmeel had finished, and the other two to teach their Brethren; and in two Years time, by a pretty constant Application, for I made them transcribe it perfectly fair and intelligible, we finished our Translation, and two fair Copies. 
I then ordering the Ragams to read a Portion of it to the People constantly in the Mouch; they, from the Novelty of the Story, at first grew so exceeding fond of it, that upon the proper Expositions of it, I taught the Ragams afterwards to make, they began to apply it seriously to religious Purposes. 
My writing Ragams were very fond of their Knowledge of Letters; and Trade and Commerce now increasing, which put every one more or less in want of the same Knowledge; they made a great Profit of it, by instructing all who applied to them. This Increase of Writing, necessarily provided a Maintenance for several Persons who travelled to Norbon for Quills, and sold 
[Page 281]
them to the Swangeantines at extravagant Rates; till the Norbonese hearing that, brought them themselves to the Foot of the Mountain, where the Swangeantines bought them, as they did several other Commodities, which one Country had, and the other wanted, especially Iron Wares of almost every Denomination; so that the Mountain being so excessive high, was the Barrier; for the Norbonese finding that Difficulty in ascending and descending, which the Swangeantines with their Graundees did not; there was a constant Market of Buyers and Sellers on the Mount Alkoe Side of the black Mountain; which by Degrees grew the general Mart of the three Kingdoms. 
I have often reflected with myself, and have been amazed to think, that so ingenious and industrious a People, as the Swangeantines have since appeared to be; and who till I came amongst them, had nothing more than bare Food, and a Hole to lie in, in a barren rocky Country, and then seemed to desire only what they had; should in ten Years time, be supplied not only with the Conveniencies, but Superfluities of Life; and that they should then become so fond of them; as rather willingly to part with Life itself, than be reduced to the State I found them in. And I have as often on this Occasion reflected on the Goodness of Providence, in 
[Page 282]
rendring one part of Mankind easy under the Absence of such Comforts, as others could not rest without; and have made it a great Argument for my Assent to well-attested Truths above my Comprehension. For, says I, to have affirmed at my first coming, either that these things could have been made at all, or when done could have been of any additional Benefit to these People, would have been so far beyond their Imaginations, that the Reporter of so plain a Truth, as they now find it, would have been looked upon as a Madman or an Imposter: But by opening their Views by little and little, and shewing them the Dependance of one thing upon another; he that should now affirm the Inutility of them, would be observed in a much worse Light. And yet, without any Imbellishments of Art, how did this so great a People live under the Protection of Providence? Let us first view them at a vast Distance from any sort of Sustenance, yet from the Help of the Graundee, that Distance was but a Step to them. They were forced to inhabit the Rocks, from an utter Incapacity of providing Shelter else where, having no Tool that would either cut down Timber for an Habitation, or dig up the Earth for a Fence, or Materials to make one: But they had a Liquor that would dissolve the Rock itself into Habitations. They had neither Beast or Fish, for Food or 
[Page 283]
Burthen: But they had Fruits equivalent to both, of the same Relish, and as wholesome without shedding Blood. Their Fruits were dangerous, till they had fermented in a boiling Heat; and they had neither the Sun, or any Fire, or the Knowledge how to propagate or continue it. But they had their hot Springs always boiling, without their Care or Concern. They had neither the Skins of Beasts, the original Cloathing, or any other artificial Covering from the Weather; but they were born with that warm Cloathing the Graundee, which being of a considerable Density, and full of Veins flowing with warm Blood, not only defended their Flesh from all outward Injuries, but was a most soft, comely, and warm Dress to the Body. They lived mostly in the dark Rock, having less Difference of Light with the Change of Seasons, than other People have: But either by Custom or Make, more Light than what Providence has sent them in the Sweecoe, is disagreeable: So that where little is to be obtained, Providence by confining the Capacity, can give Content with that; and where apparent Wants are, we may see by these People, how careful Providence is to supply them; for neither the Graundee, the Sweecoes, or their Springs, are to be found where those Necessaries can be supplied by other means. 
Amongst my other Considerations, I have often thought, that if I had gone to the Top of 
[Page 284]
the black Mountains Northward of Brandleguarp, in the very lightest time, I might have seen the Sun; but these Mountains were so elevated, that our lightest time was only the gilded Glimmering of their Tops, having never seen so much Light on them, as totally to eclipse all the Stars; of which we had always the same in view, but in different Positions. 

[Page 285]

CHAP. XXIII. 

Peter's Children provided for; Youwarkee's Death; how the King and Queen spend their time; Peter grows melancholy; wants to get to England; contrives Means; is taken up at Sea. 
I had now been at Brandleguarp ten Years, and my Children were all provided for by the King, but Dickey, as fast as they were qualified for Imployment; and such as were fit for it were married off to the best Alliances in the Country; so that I had only to sit down, and see every thing I had put my Hand to prosper, and not an evil Eye in the three Kingdoms cast at me: But about my eleventh or twelfth Year, my Wife falling into a lingering Disorder, at the End of two Years, it carried her off. This was the first real Affliction I had suffered for many Years, and so soured my Temper, that I became fit for nothing, and it was painful to me even to think of Business. 
The King's Marriage had produced four Children, three Sons and a Daughter; which he would frequently tell me were mine. 
Old Oniwheske was dead, and the King and Queen divided their whole time equally, between Brandleguarp and Apsilo: But he was Building a 
[Page 286]
Palace at my new Colony; which by this time was grown to a vast City, and was called Stygena in Compliment to the Queen; and this new Palace was designed to receive the Court one third of the Year, as it lay almost at equal Distance between both his other Palaces. This Method, which his Majesty took at my Persuasion on the Death of Oniwheske, tho' it went against the Grain at first, was now grown so habitual to him, and he saw his own Interest so much in it, in the Love and Esteem it procured him from the People, that at last he wanted no Spur to it. 
My Melancholy for the Death of my Wife, which I hoped time would wear off, rather gained ground upon me; and tho' I was as much regarded as ever by the whole Court, yet it grew troublesome to me, even to be asked my Advice; and it not only surprized those about me, but even myself, to see the same Genius, without any visible natural Decay, in so short a time, from the most sprightly and enterprizing, become the most phlegmatick and unactive. 
My Longings after my Native Country, ever since my Wife's Death, redoubled upon me; and I had formed several Schemes of getting thither; as first, I had formed a Project of going off by the Islands, as I had so many small Vessels at Command there, and to get into the main Ocean, and try my Fortune that way; but upon 
[Page 287]
Inquiry, I found that my Vessels could not get to Sea or elsewhere, but to the Zaps Islands, by reason of the many Rocks and Sand-banks which would oppose me, unless I went thro' the Zaps Country; which in the Light they had reason to view me, I was afraid to do. Then I had Thoughts of going from the Coast of Norbon; but that must have been in one of the foreign Vessels, and they coming from a quite different Quarter than I must go, in all Probability if I had put to Sea any way they were unacquainted with, they having no Compass, we must have perished; for the more I grew by Degrees acquainted with the Situation of Doorpt Swangeanti, the stronger were my Conjectures, that my nearest Continent must be the Southern Coast of America; but still it was only Conjecture. At length being tired and uneasy, I resolved as I was accustomed to Flight, and loved it; I would take a Turn for some Days, carry me where it would, I should certainly light on some Land, whence at worst I could but come back again. I then went to see if my Chair, Board, and Ropes were found, for I had not used them for several Years past; but I found them all so crazy, I durst not venture in them; which Disappointment put off my Journey for some time. However, as I had still the Thought remaining, it put me on seeking some other Method to put it in Practice: So I contrived the Poles from 
[Page 288]
which you took me, being a sort of hollow Cane the Swangeantines make their Spears of, but exceeding strong and springy; which interwoven with small Cords, were my Seat, and were much lighter than my Chair; and these buoyed me up when your Goodness relieved me. I had taken Mount Alkoe Bearers, as I knew I must come to a Country of more Light; and I now find, if I had not fallen, I must soon have reached Land, if we could have held out; for we were come too far to think of returning, without a resting place: And what will become of my poor Bearers, I dread to think, if they attempted to return, they must have dropt; for they had complained all the last Day and Night, and had shifted very often. If in your History you think fit to carry down the Life of a poor old Man any further, you will as well know what to say of me, as I can tell you; and I hope what I have hitherto said, will in some measure recompence both your Expence and Labour.
